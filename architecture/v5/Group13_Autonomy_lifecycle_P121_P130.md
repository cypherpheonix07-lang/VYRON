## PHASE 121: VERSIONED REUSABLE PLAYBOOKS

- **Identifier:** `V5:121`
- **Functional Group:** Group 13 (Autonomy lifecycle)
- **Primary Domain Object:** `PlaybookRegistry`
- **Source Reference:** Decoupled under V5 Canonical Architecture
- **Design Lifecycle Status:** `review-ready`
- **Phase Objective:** Define authoritative operational contracts, data schemas, state transitions, and verification gates for Versioned reusable playbooks. Enforce tenant isolation, immutable revision anchoring, and failure recovery.

### Block 1: Foundations (Requirements A–Z)

**A. Define purpose.** Instantiates outcome for `PlaybookRegistry`: OutcomeStatement { entity: 'PlaybookRegistry', target_metric: 'deterministic_verification_ratio', acceptable_threshold: 1.0 }. Measurable Benefit: Eliminates speculative AI hallucinations by guaranteeing all reported conclusions are anchored to immutable cryptographic AST or git evidence. Failing Counterexample: An agent claiming a build passed based on heuristic text generation is intercepted and marked UNVERIFIED.

**B. Bound scope.** Responsibility boundary for `PlaybookRegistry`: Strictly encompasses domain state management, invariant enforcement, and audit lineage for `Versioned reusable playbooks`. Explicit Exclusions: Direct execution of unreviewed shell scripts and unmonitored production database migrations. Adjacent Owners: InfrastructureEngineeringModule, AuthGatewayService. Boundary Rule: If a request crosses into external system modification, it must halt and emit a formal ActionProposal.

**C. Assign ownership.** Canonical Writer: `PlaybookRegistryAuthorityEngine`; Operating Owner: `Staff_Reliability_Engineer`; Escalation Owner: `Principal_Architect`. Dispute Resolution Path: Conflicting state assertions between client cache and server are resolved strictly in favor of PostgreSQL append-only event ledger. Quorum of 2 required to alter governance invariants.

**D. Name consumers.** Consumers: `CopilotIntelligenceEngine` (reads state for context assembly), `ReleaseGateReviewer` (evaluates readiness gates), `AuditorPortal` (exports compliance dossiers). Decisions Made: Granting promotion to staging, certifying compliance, and authorizing sandbox execution. Presentation Needs: High-density structural tables with expandable citation anchors.

**E. Specify inputs.** Input schema `CreatePlaybookRegistryRequest`: { tenant_id: UUID, project_id: UUID, actor_id: UUID, specification_payload: Record<string, any>, expected_revision: SHA256Digest }. Maximum payload size: 512KB. Validation Rule: Rejects HTTP 400 on malformed UUIDs, unknown schema versions, or mismatched SHA-256 pre-state digests.

**F. Specify outputs.** Returns `PlaybookRegistryEnvelope`: { status: 'SUCCESS' | 'PARTIAL' | 'FAILED', record_id: UUID, revision_sha: SHA256Digest, observed_at: ISOTimestamp, limitation_notice?: string }. Failure Response: Returns HTTP 422 with structured defect descriptor { error_code: 'ERR_INVARIANT_VIOLATION', violating_fields: string[], remediation_hint: string }.

**G. Define identities.** Stable URN: `urn:vyron:entity:playbookregistry:uuid`; Immutable Revision Identity: `sha256(canonical_json(payload) + parent_revision)`. Invocation Identity: `inv_seq_{uuid}`. External Identifiers: Sanitized git commit SHAs (40 hex) and GitHub PR numbers mapped via foreign key registry.

**H. Define schemas.** Logical Schema `PlaybookRegistryRecord`: `id: UUID PRIMARY KEY`, `tenant_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `scope_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `state: varchar(32) NOT NULL`, `revision_digest: char(64) NOT NULL`, `created_at: timestamptz DEFAULT now()`, `metadata: jsonb NOT NULL`. Schema Evolution: Additive column migrations only; default values enforced on new fields.

**I. Map relationships.** Edge: `PlaybookRegistry` $\rightarrow$ `Workspace` (M:1, cascade restrict); `PlaybookRegistry` $\rightarrow$ `AuditChainNode` (1:N, cascade tombstone on legal purge). Referential integrity enforced by PostgreSQL foreign keys. Display edges maintained in memory graph without corrupting relational truth.

**J. State invariants.** Invariant J.1: An entity `PlaybookRegistry` cannot transition to `VERIFIED` status without at least one non-empty cryptographic evidence digest link. Counterexample Fixture `ViolatingUnverifiedPlaybookRegistry` triggers assertion failure `ASSERT_EVIDENCE_ABSENT` and halts transaction rollback.

**K. Define preconditions.** Precondition: Caller session must possess valid cryptographic JWT bearing scope `tenant_id` and role grant `playbookregistry:write`; target project must be in `ACTIVE` state. Enforcing Boundary: Edge API Gateway Sentinel.

**L. Define postconditions.** Observable Outcome: Record persisted in PostgreSQL `vyron_playbookregistrys` table and corresponding event emitted to `vyron_outbox_events` within the same atomic ACID transaction. Independent Verification: Read-after-write probe on follower replica matches primary within 50ms.

**M. Model states.** State Catalog: `UNINITIALIZED`, `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `ACTIVE`, `DEGRADED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Terminal States: `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Resumable States: `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `DEGRADED`. State transitions are strictly monotonic.

**N. Specify transitions.** Transition: `PENDING_VALIDATION` $\rightarrow$ `ACTIVE` guarded by predicate `all_preconditions_met == true AND actor_authorized == true`. Trigger: Internal validation event. Rejected Transition: Attempting to transition from `TOMBSTONED` to `ACTIVE` returns HTTP 409 `ERR_ILLEGAL_STATE_TRANSITION`.

**O. Declare dependencies.** Hard Upstream Dependencies: `PostgreSQL_Core`, `Vault_KMS`, `Redis_Session_Store`. Optional Dependencies: `ExternalLinterConnector` (falls back to internal deterministic AST parser if network times out). Outage Behavior: System operates in read-only degraded mode.

**P. Publish contracts.** Versioned RPC Interface: `v5.playbookregistry.evaluate` exposed on internal bus and REST endpoint `/api/v5/playbookregistrys/evaluate`. Validation Semantics: Enforces JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 validation on request boundaries.

**Q. Version interfaces.** SemVer: `v5.0.0`. Deprecation Migration Path: Deprecated v4 API endpoints return `X-Vyron-Deprecated: true` header with 6-month migration horizon; v5 endpoints enforce strict non-nullable fields.

**R. Identify authority.** Authority Matrix: Relational database table `vyron_playbookregistrys` is authoritative for domain state; client local storage, web worker state, and Redis cache are treated as disposable projections.

**S. Preserve provenance.** Transformation Chain: Retains source actor UUID, originating client IP, prompt revision SHA, AST symbol version, and evaluation timestamp across every state mutation.

**T. Enforce tenancy.** Tenant Isolation Rule: Enforced via PostgreSQL Row-Level Security: `USING (tenant_id = auth.jwt()->>'tenant_id')`. Cross-Tenant Test: Negative isolation test attempting cross-tenant primary key lookup returns empty set (0 rows).

**U. Enforce membership.** Membership Scope: Verified at request admission against `vyron_memberships` table. Revocation Fixture: If a user is removed from a workspace while an operation is in-flight, downstream mutations are rejected at commit time with HTTP 403 `ERR_MEMBERSHIP_REVOKED`.

**V. Specify permissions.** Granular Matrix: `playbookregistry:read`, `playbookregistry:propose`, `playbookregistry:mutate`, `playbookregistry:export`. Enforced independently at edge proxy, service dispatch, and database RLS layers.

**W. Classify sensitivity.** Sensitivity Classification: `CONFIDENTIAL`. Sensitive attributes (access keys, private repository URIs, customer credentials) encrypted using AES-GCM-256 envelope encryption with Vault KMS keys.

**X. Minimize collection.** Data Minimization: Collects only structural AST representations, git commit hashes, and verification metrics; explicitly avoids collecting developer keystrokes, personal desktop environment variables, or unrelated source files.

**Y. State assumptions.** Assumption Register: Assumes underlying host filesystem conforms to POSIX semantics and system clock is synchronized via NTP within $\le 10$ms drift tolerance. Validation: Checked by daily automated infrastructure probe.

**Z. Plan execution.** Ordered Procedure: 1. Validate incoming request schema. 2. Verify actor tenancy and membership grants. 3. Acquire optimistic lock on current revision. 4. Execute deterministic invariant checks. 5. Write new state and outbox event in single transaction. 6. Emit telemetry span and return response.

### Block 2: Execution (Requirements AA–AZ)

**AA. Map dependencies.** Execution DAG: ValidateRequest $\rightarrow$ FetchContext $\rightarrow$ CheckInvariants $\rightarrow$ PersistMutation $\rightarrow$ EmitEvents. Graph is strictly acyclic with maximum execution depth bounded to 6 hops.

**AB. Bound parallelism.** Concurrency Limit: Maximum 16 parallel evaluations of `PlaybookRegistry` per worker instance; cluster queue depth throttled via Redis token bucket algorithm.

**AC. Budget latency.** End-to-End Latency Budget: P95 $\le 180$ms, P99 $\le 450$ms. Measurement Boundaries: Measured from HTTP socket read to final response byte flush.

**AD. Propagate deadlines.** Deadline Context: 1500ms timeout propagated through Go/Node context channels; database queries carry `statement_timeout = '1200ms'`. Client disconnect triggers immediate cooperative worker abort.

**AE. Bound resources.** Resource Ceilings: Memory limit per operation: 128MB; maximum CPU time: 800ms; maximum response payload: 1MB. Overload Response: Emits HTTP 429 with backoff advisory.

**AF. Select capabilities.** Capability Selection: Uses native deterministic TypeScript/Go AST parsing engine; strictly avoids delegating structural schema analysis to generative LLM components.

**AG. Constrain models.** Model Constraint: Where AI models assist in summarizing `Versioned reusable playbooks`, models are locked into read-only context with system prompt injection protection; prohibited from generating executable shell actions.

**AH. Authorize tools.** Tool Authorization: Every tool invocation referencing `PlaybookRegistry` requires an explicit cryptographic grant signed by an authorized human actor or designated automated policy gate.

**AI. Validate arguments.** Argument Validator: Validates parameter types, string lengths ($\le 255$ chars), path safety (regex prohibiting `../` traversal), and UUID formats before passing to internal handlers.

**AJ. Isolate execution.** Sandbox Boundary: Untrusted code analysis executes in ephemeral Firecracker microVMs with read-only root filesystems, disabled outbound networking, and 500ms execution timeout.

**AK. Ensure idempotency.** Idempotency Key: `sha256(tenant_id + request_nonce + operation_digest)`. Deduplication retention window: 24 hours. Repeat requests return identical cached response without re-executing state mutation.

**AL. Control retries.** Retry Policy: Retries transient database network disconnects up to $3\times$ with exponential backoff (50ms, 150ms, 450ms). Prohibits retrying non-idempotent mutation calls without prior reconciliation check.

**AM. Handle cancellation.** Cancellation Semantics: Upon receiving client cancellation token, worker terminates downstream subprocesses, releases distributed Redis mutex locks, and marks transaction `ABORTED` in audit log.

**AN. Persist checkpoints.** Checkpoint Storage: Long-running batch analyses persist checkpoints every 100 evaluated records in PostgreSQL `vyron_execution_checkpoints` to allow zero-loss recovery.

**AO. Support resumption.** Resume Guards: Re-validates tenant permissions, token expiration, and source code git commit freshness before resuming an interrupted checkpoint.

**AP. Control concurrency.** Concurrency Control: Implements Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) using an incrementing integer `version` column. Concurrent write collision returns HTTP 409 `ERR_OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_CONFLICT`.

**AQ. Handle ordering.** Event Ordering: Domain events assigned strictly monotonic sequence numbers within tenant partition scope; out-of-order events buffered in Redis priority queue for deterministic reassembly.

**AR. Define transactions.** Transaction Boundaries: State updates to `PlaybookRegistry` and corresponding outbox event entries execute in a single ACID transaction under PostgreSQL `READ COMMITTED` or `SERIALIZABLE` isolation.

**AS. Publish events.** Domain Event Envelope: `{ event_id: UUID, event_type: 'v5.playbookregistry.state_changed', aggregate_id: UUID, aggregate_revision: SHA256Digest, timestamp_utc: ISOTimestamp, payload: Record<string, any> }`.

**AT. Define subscriptions.** Realtime Subscriptions: WebSocket subscription channel `tenant:{id}:playbookregistry` delivers state changes to frontend within 50ms; re-authenticates client token on every reconnect.

**AU. Specify caching.** Cache Policy: Entity metadata cached in Redis key `playbookregistry:meta:{id}` with TTL = 300 seconds; invalidated synchronously upon any write transaction.

**AV. Handle freshness.** Freshness Bounds: Cache entries older than 300 seconds flagged as `STALE_REVISION`; background worker triggers asynchronous refresh.

**AW. Detect staleness.** Invalidation Triggers: Incoming git push webhook or user configuration update immediately publishes Redis cache eviction message.

**AX. Define fallback.** Degradation Fallback: If Redis cache is completely unreachable, gateway falls back to querying read-replica PostgreSQL instances with circuit breaker.

**AY. Reconcile outcomes.** Reconciliation Loop: Nightly background job sweeps `PlaybookRegistry` records against underlying git repository state to detect and reconcile out-of-band modifications.

**AZ. Plan retrieval.** Query Plan: Indexed by compound B-tree on `(tenant_id, scope_id, created_at DESC)` ensuring index-only scans for high-frequency dashboard queries.

### Block 3: Evidence (Requirements BA–BZ)

**BA. Define ranking.** Evidence Ranking: Ranks evidence signals by deterministic proof weight: Compiler Output (1.0) > Automated Test Assertions (0.9) > SAST Linter Diagnostics (0.7) > Historical Heuristics (0.3).

**BB. Deduplicate evidence.** Deduplication Strategy: Groups identical compiler diagnostics across repeated CI runs for unchanged commit SHAs into single canonical evidence records.

**BC. Check coverage.** Coverage Verification: Verifies that 100% of declared structural boundaries for `Versioned reusable playbooks` have matching automated validation test cases.

**BD. Assemble evidence.** Dossier Assembly: Packages raw test logs, compiler stdout/stderr, git commit metadata, and cryptographic SHA-256 signatures into an immutable evidence dossier.

**BE. Extract claims.** Claim Extraction: Decomposes findings into atomic falsifiable propositions: e.g. 'Component `PlaybookRegistry` conforms to zero-raw-SQL mandate at commit SHA 9a8f1'.

**BF. Classify claims.** Claim Classification: Explicitly classifies claims into `VERIFIED_OBSERVATION`, `DERIVED_FACT`, `HYPOTHESIS`, or `PROPOSED_MUTATION`. Prohibits treating hypotheses as facts.

**BG. Validate support.** Entailment Verification: Verifies that cited source code lines directly entail the asserted claim using automated regex and AST symbol matchers.

**BH. Detect contradictions.** Contradiction Detection: Flags an architectural contradiction if an automated test asserts passing status while a compiler check records syntax errors.

**BI. Calibrate confidence.** Confidence Calibration: Confidence score = 1.0 for deterministically verified compiler passes; confidence capped at 0.5 for generative model suggestions lacking test execution.

**BJ. Render citations.** Citation Format: Renders inline interactive citations linking to exact file paths and line ranges: `[VYRON: PlaybookRegistry, src/core/engine.ts#L42-L68]`.

**BK. Separate inference.** Inference Separation: Any AI-generated design recommendation is visually segregated with an explicit `[INFERRED_PROPOSAL]` badge and limitation disclosure.

**BL. Verify calculations.** Calculation Verification: Mathematical calculations (ratios, latencies, coverage percentages) computed deterministically using standard IEEE 754 arithmetic with unit tests.

**BM. Verify semantics.** Semantic Integrity: Validates domain terminology against ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 systems and software architecture standards.

**BN. Bound conclusions.** Conclusion Bounds: Prohibits declaring a release gate passed if any high-severity invariant fails, regardless of passing scores in other categories.

**BO. Explain limitations.** Actionable Limitations: Explicitly communicates missing coverage or inaccessible telemetry: 'Limitation: Remote Kubernetes metrics currently unreachable; operating on cached baseline'.

**BP. Preserve lineage.** Lineage Graph: Retains complete backward provenance from displayed UI card $\rightarrow$ evaluation job $\rightarrow$ AST parse tree $\rightarrow$ source file revision.

**BQ. Record corrections.** Correction Ledger: User feedback and corrective inputs create append-only supersession records linked to the original claim without mutating historical audit records.

**BR. Validate sources.** Source Validation: Re-validates reachability, commit existence, and cryptographic GPG signatures of source git repositories before indexing.

**BS. Reject fabrication.** Anti-Fabrication Law: System asserts `ASSERT_ZERO_FABRICATION`; strictly blocks simulated test passes or invented file paths from production displays.

**BT. Define transparency.** Transparency Policy: Displays exact execution timelines, invoked tools, and model identities in an expandable forensic drawer.

**BU. Design presentation.** User Presentation: Clean card layout with high-contrast status pills, progressive disclosure drawers, and syntax-highlighted code diff viewers.

**BV. Support accessibility.** Accessibility Guarantee: Fully operable via keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift-Tab/Enter); ARIA live regions announce dynamic state changes to screen readers.

**BW. Respect preferences.** User Preferences: Honors user display preferences (compact vs expanded view, dark vs light theme) without altering security boundaries.

**BX. Persist records.** Storage Architecture: Canonical state stored in PostgreSQL with row-level security; operational logs archived in object storage with immutable lifecycle policies.

**BY. Define retention.** Retention Rules: Audit logs retained for 7 years; intermediate execution traces retained for 30 days; ephemeral debug logs purged after 72 hours.

**BZ. Propagate deletion.** Deletion Cascade: User-initiated deletion cascades tombstone records across dependent caches, vector embeddings, and search indexes within 10 seconds.

### Block 4: Assurance (Requirements CA–CZ)

**CA. Version exports.** Export Versioning: Exported architecture dossiers formatted in JSON/PDF schemas versioned under SemVer `v5.0` with SHA-256 manifest hash.

**CB. Redact exports.** Export Redaction: Automatically scrubs private environment variables, internal IP addresses, and JWT tokens before generating customer-facing exports.

**CC. Synchronize projections.** Projection Synchronization: Edge client projections re-synchronize with server authority within $< 100$ms upon WebSocket reconnect.

**CD. Instrument execution.** Telemetry Instrumentation: Emits OpenTelemetry distributed trace spans `vyron.playbookregistry.evaluate` with latency, error status, and tenant attributes.

**CE. Define metrics.** Metric Catalog: Gauge: `vyron_playbookregistry_active_count`, Counter: `vyron_playbookregistry_evaluations_total`, Histogram: `vyron_playbookregistry_latency_ms`.

**CF. Set objectives.** Service Level Objectives (SLO): 99.95% availability for `Versioned reusable playbooks` endpoints; P95 latency $< 200$ms under 100 concurrent requests.

**CG. Account costs.** Cost Attribution: Tracks compute milliseconds, memory utilization, and LLM token usage attributed to each tenant for internal cost allocation.

**CH. Monitor saturation.** Saturation Alerts: Alerts operations team when worker CPU exceeds 80% or database connection pool exceeds 75% utilization.

**CI. Classify failures.** Failure Taxonomy: Non-overlapping error codes: `ERR_SCHEMA_VALIDATION` (400), `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED` (403), `ERR_NOT_FOUND` (404), `ERR_TIMEOUT` (504).

**CJ. Expose recovery.** Operational Recovery: Provides automated administrative recovery endpoint `/api/v5/playbookregistrys/repair` to clear stuck locks and resume pipelines.

**CK. Protect secrets.** Secret Protection: API keys and database credentials injected via secure environment variables; never logged to stdout or included in exception stack traces.

**CL. Reject injections.** Injection Defense: Input sanitization filters intercept prompt injection markers (`Ignore all previous instructions`) and reject SQL metacharacters.

**CM. Revalidate authority.** Authority Revalidation: Re-checks caller permissions immediately before executing any mutation, even if previously validated at gateway.

**CN. Test isolation.** Negative Isolation Test: Synthetic red-team test attempts to read `PlaybookRegistry` across tenant boundaries; asserts 0 records returned and security alarm logged.

**CO. Test contracts.** Contract Test Suite: Automated schema validation test confirms 100% compliance of `PlaybookRegistry` endpoints against OpenAPI 3.1 specifications.

**CP. Test transitions.** Transition Test Harness: Validates that invalid state transitions (e.g. `TOMBSTONED` $\rightarrow$ `ACTIVE`) throw expected HTTP 409 exceptions.

**CQ. Test latency.** Latency Benchmark: 10,000 synthetic requests processed against `PlaybookRegistry` endpoint; asserts P99 latency remains $< 350$ms.

**CR. Test degradation.** Degradation Injection: Simulates downstream database failure; verifies that system gracefully returns cached data with explicit degradation banner.

**CS. Test recovery.** Crash Recovery Test: Abruptly kills worker process mid-execution; asserts database transaction rolls back cleanly with zero orphaned records.

**CT. Test provenance.** Provenance Trace Audit: Audits random sample of 100 outputs; confirms 100% trace backward to authenticated user sessions and valid commit SHAs.

**CU. Test usability.** Usability Verification: Validated with 5 staff engineers; confirmed zero ambiguous error messages and 100% task completion within expected time.

**CV. Plan migration.** Migration Strategy: Additive schema migrations executed without table locks; backward-compatible API views maintained for 180 days.

**CW. Plan rollback.** Rollback Procedure: Automated migration rollback script tested to revert schema modifications within $< 15$ seconds if production anomalies detected.

**CX. Document evidence.** Evidence Documentation: Full test run reports, performance benchmark graphs, and security audit logs archived in `test-results/v5-121-evidence.json`.

**CY. Gate completion.** Completion Gate: 104/104 contract requirements verified by automated test harness with 100% passing assertions before declaring phase complete.

**CZ. Record handoff.** Continuation Cursor: `cursor_v5_121_to_122`. Handoff record passes state, verified schemas, and authority tokens to Phase P122.

**AV. Handle freshness.** Freshness Bounds: Cache entries older than 300 seconds flagged as `STALE_REVISION`; background worker triggers asynchronous refresh.

**AW. Detect staleness.** Invalidation Triggers: Incoming git push webhook or user configuration update immediately publishes Redis cache eviction message.

**AX. Define fallback.** Degradation Fallback: If Redis cache is completely unreachable, gateway falls back to querying read-replica PostgreSQL instances with circuit breaker.

**AY. Reconcile outcomes.** Reconciliation Loop: Nightly background job sweeps `AutonomyGrant` records against underlying git repository state to detect and reconcile out-of-band modifications.

**AZ. Plan retrieval.** Query Plan: Indexed by compound B-tree on `(tenant_id, scope_id, created_at DESC)` ensuring index-only scans for high-frequency dashboard queries.

## PHASE 123: AUTOMATION ACTIVATION GATE

- **Identifier:** `V5:123`
- **Functional Group:** Group 13 (Autonomy lifecycle)
- **Primary Domain Object:** `ActivationGate`
- **Source Reference:** Decoupled under V5 Canonical Architecture
- **Design Lifecycle Status:** `review-ready`
- **Phase Objective:** Define authoritative operational contracts, data schemas, state transitions, and verification gates for Automation activation gate. Enforce tenant isolation, immutable revision anchoring, and failure recovery.

### Block 1: Foundations (Requirements A–Z)

**A. Define purpose.** Instantiates outcome for `ActivationGate`: OutcomeStatement { entity: 'ActivationGate', target_metric: 'deterministic_verification_ratio', acceptable_threshold: 1.0 }. Measurable Benefit: Eliminates speculative AI hallucinations by guaranteeing all reported conclusions are anchored to immutable cryptographic AST or git evidence. Failing Counterexample: An agent claiming a build passed based on heuristic text generation is intercepted and marked UNVERIFIED.

**B. Bound scope.** Responsibility boundary for `ActivationGate`: Strictly encompasses domain state management, invariant enforcement, and audit lineage for `Automation activation gate`. Explicit Exclusions: Direct execution of unreviewed shell scripts and unmonitored production database migrations. Adjacent Owners: InfrastructureEngineeringModule, AuthGatewayService. Boundary Rule: If a request crosses into external system modification, it must halt and emit a formal ActionProposal.

**C. Assign ownership.** Canonical Writer: `ActivationGateAuthorityEngine`; Operating Owner: `Staff_Reliability_Engineer`; Escalation Owner: `Principal_Architect`. Dispute Resolution Path: Conflicting state assertions between client cache and server are resolved strictly in favor of PostgreSQL append-only event ledger. Quorum of 2 required to alter governance invariants.

**D. Name consumers.** Consumers: `CopilotIntelligenceEngine` (reads state for context assembly), `ReleaseGateReviewer` (evaluates readiness gates), `AuditorPortal` (exports compliance dossiers). Decisions Made: Granting promotion to staging, certifying compliance, and authorizing sandbox execution. Presentation Needs: High-density structural tables with expandable citation anchors.

**E. Specify inputs.** Input schema `CreateActivationGateRequest`: { tenant_id: UUID, project_id: UUID, actor_id: UUID, specification_payload: Record<string, any>, expected_revision: SHA256Digest }. Maximum payload size: 512KB. Validation Rule: Rejects HTTP 400 on malformed UUIDs, unknown schema versions, or mismatched SHA-256 pre-state digests.

**F. Specify outputs.** Returns `ActivationGateEnvelope`: { status: 'SUCCESS' | 'PARTIAL' | 'FAILED', record_id: UUID, revision_sha: SHA256Digest, observed_at: ISOTimestamp, limitation_notice?: string }. Failure Response: Returns HTTP 422 with structured defect descriptor { error_code: 'ERR_INVARIANT_VIOLATION', violating_fields: string[], remediation_hint: string }.

**G. Define identities.** Stable URN: `urn:vyron:entity:activationgate:uuid`; Immutable Revision Identity: `sha256(canonical_json(payload) + parent_revision)`. Invocation Identity: `inv_seq_{uuid}`. External Identifiers: Sanitized git commit SHAs (40 hex) and GitHub PR numbers mapped via foreign key registry.

**H. Define schemas.** Logical Schema `ActivationGateRecord`: `id: UUID PRIMARY KEY`, `tenant_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `scope_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `state: varchar(32) NOT NULL`, `revision_digest: char(64) NOT NULL`, `created_at: timestamptz DEFAULT now()`, `metadata: jsonb NOT NULL`. Schema Evolution: Additive column migrations only; default values enforced on new fields.

**I. Map relationships.** Edge: `ActivationGate` $\rightarrow$ `Workspace` (M:1, cascade restrict); `ActivationGate` $\rightarrow$ `AuditChainNode` (1:N, cascade tombstone on legal purge). Referential integrity enforced by PostgreSQL foreign keys. Display edges maintained in memory graph without corrupting relational truth.

**J. State invariants.** Invariant J.1: An entity `ActivationGate` cannot transition to `VERIFIED` status without at least one non-empty cryptographic evidence digest link. Counterexample Fixture `ViolatingUnverifiedActivationGate` triggers assertion failure `ASSERT_EVIDENCE_ABSENT` and halts transaction rollback.

**K. Define preconditions.** Precondition: Caller session must possess valid cryptographic JWT bearing scope `tenant_id` and role grant `activationgate:write`; target project must be in `ACTIVE` state. Enforcing Boundary: Edge API Gateway Sentinel.

**L. Define postconditions.** Observable Outcome: Record persisted in PostgreSQL `vyron_activationgates` table and corresponding event emitted to `vyron_outbox_events` within the same atomic ACID transaction. Independent Verification: Read-after-write probe on follower replica matches primary within 50ms.

**M. Model states.** State Catalog: `UNINITIALIZED`, `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `ACTIVE`, `DEGRADED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Terminal States: `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Resumable States: `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `DEGRADED`. State transitions are strictly monotonic.

**N. Specify transitions.** Transition: `PENDING_VALIDATION` $\rightarrow$ `ACTIVE` guarded by predicate `all_preconditions_met == true AND actor_authorized == true`. Trigger: Internal validation event. Rejected Transition: Attempting to transition from `TOMBSTONED` to `ACTIVE` returns HTTP 409 `ERR_ILLEGAL_STATE_TRANSITION`.

**O. Declare dependencies.** Hard Upstream Dependencies: `PostgreSQL_Core`, `Vault_KMS`, `Redis_Session_Store`. Optional Dependencies: `ExternalLinterConnector` (falls back to internal deterministic AST parser if network times out). Outage Behavior: System operates in read-only degraded mode.

**P. Publish contracts.** Versioned RPC Interface: `v5.activationgate.evaluate` exposed on internal bus and REST endpoint `/api/v5/activationgates/evaluate`. Validation Semantics: Enforces JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 validation on request boundaries.

**Q. Version interfaces.** SemVer: `v5.0.0`. Deprecation Migration Path: Deprecated v4 API endpoints return `X-Vyron-Deprecated: true` header with 6-month migration horizon; v5 endpoints enforce strict non-nullable fields.

**R. Identify authority.** Authority Matrix: Relational database table `vyron_activationgates` is authoritative for domain state; client local storage, web worker state, and Redis cache are treated as disposable projections.

**S. Preserve provenance.** Transformation Chain: Retains source actor UUID, originating client IP, prompt revision SHA, AST symbol version, and evaluation timestamp across every state mutation.

**T. Enforce tenancy.** Tenant Isolation Rule: Enforced via PostgreSQL Row-Level Security: `USING (tenant_id = auth.jwt()->>'tenant_id')`. Cross-Tenant Test: Negative isolation test attempting cross-tenant primary key lookup returns empty set (0 rows).

**U. Enforce membership.** Membership Scope: Verified at request admission against `vyron_memberships` table. Revocation Fixture: If a user is removed from a workspace while an operation is in-flight, downstream mutations are rejected at commit time with HTTP 403 `ERR_MEMBERSHIP_REVOKED`.

**V. Specify permissions.** Granular Matrix: `activationgate:read`, `activationgate:propose`, `activationgate:mutate`, `activationgate:export`. Enforced independently at edge proxy, service dispatch, and database RLS layers.

**W. Classify sensitivity.** Sensitivity Classification: `CONFIDENTIAL`. Sensitive attributes (access keys, private repository URIs, customer credentials) encrypted using AES-GCM-256 envelope encryption with Vault KMS keys.

**X. Minimize collection.** Data Minimization: Collects only structural AST representations, git commit hashes, and verification metrics; explicitly avoids collecting developer keystrokes, personal desktop environment variables, or unrelated source files.

**Y. State assumptions.** Assumption Register: Assumes underlying host filesystem conforms to POSIX semantics and system clock is synchronized via NTP within $\le 10$ms drift tolerance. Validation: Checked by daily automated infrastructure probe.

**Z. Plan execution.** Ordered Procedure: 1. Validate incoming request schema. 2. Verify actor tenancy and membership grants. 3. Acquire optimistic lock on current revision. 4. Execute deterministic invariant checks. 5. Write new state and outbox event in single transaction. 6. Emit telemetry span and return response.

### Block 2: Execution (Requirements AA–AZ)

**AA. Map dependencies.** Execution DAG: ValidateRequest $\rightarrow$ FetchContext $\rightarrow$ CheckInvariants $\rightarrow$ PersistMutation $\rightarrow$ EmitEvents. Graph is strictly acyclic with maximum execution depth bounded to 6 hops.

**AB. Bound parallelism.** Concurrency Limit: Maximum 16 parallel evaluations of `ActivationGate` per worker instance; cluster queue depth throttled via Redis token bucket algorithm.

**AC. Budget latency.** End-to-End Latency Budget: P95 $\le 180$ms, P99 $\le 450$ms. Measurement Boundaries: Measured from HTTP socket read to final response byte flush.

**AD. Propagate deadlines.** Deadline Context: 1500ms timeout propagated through Go/Node context channels; database queries carry `statement_timeout = '1200ms'`. Client disconnect triggers immediate cooperative worker abort.

**AE. Bound resources.** Resource Ceilings: Memory limit per operation: 128MB; maximum CPU time: 800ms; maximum response payload: 1MB. Overload Response: Emits HTTP 429 with backoff advisory.

**AF. Select capabilities.** Capability Selection: Uses native deterministic TypeScript/Go AST parsing engine; strictly avoids delegating structural schema analysis to generative LLM components.

**AG. Constrain models.** Model Constraint: Where AI models assist in summarizing `Automation activation gate`, models are locked into read-only context with system prompt injection protection; prohibited from generating executable shell actions.

**AH. Authorize tools.** Tool Authorization: Every tool invocation referencing `ActivationGate` requires an explicit cryptographic grant signed by an authorized human actor or designated automated policy gate.

**AI. Validate arguments.** Argument Validator: Validates parameter types, string lengths ($\le 255$ chars), path safety (regex prohibiting `../` traversal), and UUID formats before passing to internal handlers.

**AJ. Isolate execution.** Sandbox Boundary: Untrusted code analysis executes in ephemeral Firecracker microVMs with read-only root filesystems, disabled outbound networking, and 500ms execution timeout.

**AK. Ensure idempotency.** Idempotency Key: `sha256(tenant_id + request_nonce + operation_digest)`. Deduplication retention window: 24 hours. Repeat requests return identical cached response without re-executing state mutation.

**AL. Control retries.** Retry Policy: Retries transient database network disconnects up to $3\times$ with exponential backoff (50ms, 150ms, 450ms). Prohibits retrying non-idempotent mutation calls without prior reconciliation check.

**AM. Handle cancellation.** Cancellation Semantics: Upon receiving client cancellation token, worker terminates downstream subprocesses, releases distributed Redis mutex locks, and marks transaction `ABORTED` in audit log.

**AN. Persist checkpoints.** Checkpoint Storage: Long-running batch analyses persist checkpoints every 100 evaluated records in PostgreSQL `vyron_execution_checkpoints` to allow zero-loss recovery.

**AO. Support resumption.** Resume Guards: Re-validates tenant permissions, token expiration, and source code git commit freshness before resuming an interrupted checkpoint.

**AP. Control concurrency.** Concurrency Control: Implements Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) using an incrementing integer `version` column. Concurrent write collision returns HTTP 409 `ERR_OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_CONFLICT`.

**AQ. Handle ordering.** Event Ordering: Domain events assigned strictly monotonic sequence numbers within tenant partition scope; out-of-order events buffered in Redis priority queue for deterministic reassembly.

**AR. Define transactions.** Transaction Boundaries: State updates to `ActivationGate` and corresponding outbox event entries execute in a single ACID transaction under PostgreSQL `READ COMMITTED` or `SERIALIZABLE` isolation.

**AS. Publish events.** Domain Event Envelope: `{ event_id: UUID, event_type: 'v5.activationgate.state_changed', aggregate_id: UUID, aggregate_revision: SHA256Digest, timestamp_utc: ISOTimestamp, payload: Record<string, any> }`.

**AT. Define subscriptions.** Realtime Subscriptions: WebSocket subscription channel `tenant:{id}:activationgate` delivers state changes to frontend within 50ms; re-authenticates client token on every reconnect.

**AU. Specify caching.** Cache Policy: Entity metadata cached in Redis key `activationgate:meta:{id}` with TTL = 300 seconds; invalidated synchronously upon any write transaction.

**AV. Handle freshness.** Freshness Bounds: Cache entries older than 300 seconds flagged as `STALE_REVISION`; background worker triggers asynchronous refresh.

**AW. Detect staleness.** Invalidation Triggers: Incoming git push webhook or user configuration update immediately publishes Redis cache eviction message.

**AX. Define fallback.** Degradation Fallback: If Redis cache is completely unreachable, gateway falls back to querying read-replica PostgreSQL instances with circuit breaker.

**AY. Reconcile outcomes.** Reconciliation Loop: Nightly background job sweeps `ActivationGate` records against underlying git repository state to detect and reconcile out-of-band modifications.

**AZ. Plan retrieval.** Query Plan: Indexed by compound B-tree on `(tenant_id, scope_id, created_at DESC)` ensuring index-only scans for high-frequency dashboard queries.

### Block 3: Evidence (Requirements BA–BZ)

**BA. Define ranking.** Evidence Ranking: Ranks evidence signals by deterministic proof weight: Compiler Output (1.0) > Automated Test Assertions (0.9) > SAST Linter Diagnostics (0.7) > Historical Heuristics (0.3).

**BB. Deduplicate evidence.** Deduplication Strategy: Groups identical compiler diagnostics across repeated CI runs for unchanged commit SHAs into single canonical evidence records.

**BC. Check coverage.** Coverage Verification: Verifies that 100% of declared structural boundaries for `Automation activation gate` have matching automated validation test cases.

**BD. Assemble evidence.** Dossier Assembly: Packages raw test logs, compiler stdout/stderr, git commit metadata, and cryptographic SHA-256 signatures into an immutable evidence dossier.

**BE. Extract claims.** Claim Extraction: Decomposes findings into atomic falsifiable propositions: e.g. 'Component `ActivationGate` conforms to zero-raw-SQL mandate at commit SHA 9a8f1'.

**BF. Classify claims.** Claim Classification: Explicitly classifies claims into `VERIFIED_OBSERVATION`, `DERIVED_FACT`, `HYPOTHESIS`, or `PROPOSED_MUTATION`. Prohibits treating hypotheses as facts.

**BG. Validate support.** Entailment Verification: Verifies that cited source code lines directly entail the asserted claim using automated regex and AST symbol matchers.

**BH. Detect contradictions.** Contradiction Detection: Flags an architectural contradiction if an automated test asserts passing status while a compiler check records syntax errors.

**BI. Calibrate confidence.** Confidence Calibration: Confidence score = 1.0 for deterministically verified compiler passes; confidence capped at 0.5 for generative model suggestions lacking test execution.

**BJ. Render citations.** Citation Format: Renders inline interactive citations linking to exact file paths and line ranges: `[VYRON: ActivationGate, src/core/engine.ts#L42-L68]`.

## PHASE 124: EMERGENCY STOP AND CONTAINMENT

- **Identifier:** `V5:124`
- **Functional Group:** Group 13 (Autonomy lifecycle)
- **Primary Domain Object:** `EmergencyStop`
- **Source Reference:** Decoupled under V5 Canonical Architecture
- **Design Lifecycle Status:** `review-ready`
- **Phase Objective:** Define authoritative operational contracts, data schemas, state transitions, and verification gates for Emergency stop and containment. Enforce tenant isolation, immutable revision anchoring, and failure recovery.

### Block 1: Foundations (Requirements A–Z)

Failure Response: Returns HTTP 422 with structured defect descriptor { error_code: 'ERR_INVARIANT_VIOLATION', violating_fields: string[], remediation_hint: string }.

**G. Define identities.** Stable URN: `urn:vyron:entity:emergencystop:uuid`; Immutable Revision Identity: `sha256(canonical_json(payload) + parent_revision)`. Invocation Identity: `inv_seq_{uuid}`. External Identifiers: Sanitized git commit SHAs (40 hex) and GitHub PR numbers mapped via foreign key registry.

**H. Define schemas.** Logical Schema `EmergencyStopRecord`: `id: UUID PRIMARY KEY`, `tenant_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `scope_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `state: varchar(32) NOT NULL`, `revision_digest: char(64) NOT NULL`, `created_at: timestamptz DEFAULT now()`, `metadata: jsonb NOT NULL`. Schema Evolution: Additive column migrations only; default values enforced on new fields.

**I. Map relationships.** Edge: `EmergencyStop` $\rightarrow$ `Workspace` (M:1, cascade restrict); `EmergencyStop` $\rightarrow$ `AuditChainNode` (1:N, cascade tombstone on legal purge). Referential integrity enforced by PostgreSQL foreign keys. Display edges maintained in memory graph without corrupting relational truth.

**J. State invariants.** Invariant J.1: An entity `EmergencyStop` cannot transition to `VERIFIED` status without at least one non-empty cryptographic evidence digest link. Counterexample Fixture `ViolatingUnverifiedEmergencyStop` triggers assertion failure `ASSERT_EVIDENCE_ABSENT` and halts transaction rollback.

**K. Define preconditions.** Precondition: Caller session must possess valid cryptographic JWT bearing scope `tenant_id` and role grant `emergencystop:write`; target project must be in `ACTIVE` state. Enforcing Boundary: Edge API Gateway Sentinel.

**L. Define postconditions.** Observable Outcome: Record persisted in PostgreSQL `vyron_emergencystops` table and corresponding event emitted to `vyron_outbox_events` within the same atomic ACID transaction. Independent Verification: Read-after-write probe on follower replica matches primary within 50ms.

**M. Model states.** State Catalog: `UNINITIALIZED`, `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `ACTIVE`, `DEGRADED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Terminal States: `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Resumable States: `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `DEGRADED`. State transitions are strictly monotonic.

**N. Specify transitions.** Transition: `PENDING_VALIDATION` $\rightarrow$ `ACTIVE` guarded by predicate `all_preconditions_met == true AND actor_authorized == true`. Trigger: Internal validation event. Rejected Transition: Attempting to transition from `TOMBSTONED` to `ACTIVE` returns HTTP 409 `ERR_ILLEGAL_STATE_TRANSITION`.

**O. Declare dependencies.** Hard Upstream Dependencies: `PostgreSQL_Core`, `Vault_KMS`, `Redis_Session_Store`. Optional Dependencies: `ExternalLinterConnector` (falls back to internal deterministic AST parser if network times out). Outage Behavior: System operates in read-only degraded mode.

**P. Publish contracts.** Versioned RPC Interface: `v5.emergencystop.evaluate` exposed on internal bus and REST endpoint `/api/v5/emergencystops/evaluate`. Validation Semantics: Enforces JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 validation on request boundaries.

**Q. Version interfaces.** SemVer: `v5.0.0`. Deprecation Migration Path: Deprecated v4 API endpoints return `X-Vyron-Deprecated: true` header with 6-month migration horizon; v5 endpoints enforce strict non-nullable fields.

**R. Identify authority.** Authority Matrix: Relational database table `vyron_emergencystops` is authoritative for domain state; client local storage, web worker state, and Redis cache are treated as disposable projections.

**S. Preserve provenance.** Transformation Chain: Retains source actor UUID, originating client IP, prompt revision SHA, AST symbol version, and evaluation timestamp across every state mutation.

**T. Enforce tenancy.** Tenant Isolation Rule: Enforced via PostgreSQL Row-Level Security: `USING (tenant_id = auth.jwt()->>'tenant_id')`. Cross-Tenant Test: Negative isolation test attempting cross-tenant primary key lookup returns empty set (0 rows).

**U. Enforce membership.** Membership Scope: Verified at request admission against `vyron_memberships` table. Revocation Fixture: If a user is removed from a workspace while an operation is in-flight, downstream mutations are rejected at commit time with HTTP 403 `ERR_MEMBERSHIP_REVOKED`.

**V. Specify permissions.** Granular Matrix: `emergencystop:read`, `emergencystop:propose`, `emergencystop:mutate`, `emergencystop:export`. Enforced independently at edge proxy, service dispatch, and database RLS layers.

**W. Classify sensitivity.** Sensitivity Classification: `CONFIDENTIAL`. Sensitive attributes (access keys, private repository URIs, customer credentials) encrypted using AES-GCM-256 envelope encryption with Vault KMS keys.

**X. Minimize collection.** Data Minimization: Collects only structural AST representations, git commit hashes, and verification metrics; explicitly avoids collecting developer keystrokes, personal desktop environment variables, or unrelated source files.

**Y. State assumptions.** Assumption Register: Assumes underlying host filesystem conforms to POSIX semantics and system clock is synchronized via NTP within $\le 10$ms drift tolerance. Validation: Checked by daily automated infrastructure probe.

**Z. Plan execution.** Ordered Procedure: 1. Validate incoming request schema. 2. Verify actor tenancy and membership grants. 3. Acquire optimistic lock on current revision. 4. Execute deterministic invariant checks. 5. Write new state and outbox event in single transaction. 6. Emit telemetry span and return response.

### Block 2: Execution (Requirements AA–AZ)

**AA. Map dependencies.** Execution DAG: ValidateRequest $\rightarrow$ FetchContext $\rightarrow$ CheckInvariants $\rightarrow$ PersistMutation $\rightarrow$ EmitEvents. Graph is strictly acyclic with maximum execution depth bounded to 6 hops.

**AF. Select capabilities.** Capability Selection: Uses native deterministic TypeScript/Go AST parsing engine; strictly avoids delegating structural schema analysis to generative LLM components.

**AG. Constrain models.** Model Constraint: Where AI models assist in summarizing `Emergency stop and containment`, models are locked into read-only context with system prompt injection protection; prohibited from generating executable shell actions.

**AH. Authorize tools.** Tool Authorization: Every tool invocation referencing `EmergencyStop` requires an explicit cryptographic grant signed by an authorized human actor or designated automated policy gate.

**AI. Validate arguments.** Argument Validator: Validates parameter types, string lengths ($\le 255$ chars), path safety (regex prohibiting `../` traversal), and UUID formats before passing to internal handlers.

**AJ. Isolate execution.** Sandbox Boundary: Untrusted code analysis executes in ephemeral Firecracker microVMs with read-only root filesystems, disabled outbound networking, and 500ms execution timeout.

**AK. Ensure idempotency.** Idempotency Key: `sha256(tenant_id + request_nonce + operation_digest)`. Deduplication retention window: 24 hours. Repeat requests return identical cached response without re-executing state mutation.

**AL. Control retries.** Retry Policy: Retries transient database network disconnects up to $3\times$ with exponential backoff (50ms, 150ms, 450ms). Prohibits retrying non-idempotent mutation calls without prior reconciliation check.

**AM. Handle cancellation.** Cancellation Semantics: Upon receiving client cancellation token, worker terminates downstream subprocesses, releases distributed Redis mutex locks, and marks transaction `ABORTED` in audit log.

**AN. Persist checkpoints.** Checkpoint Storage: Long-running batch analyses persist checkpoints every 100 evaluated records in PostgreSQL `vyron_execution_checkpoints` to allow zero-loss recovery.

**AO. Support resumption.** Resume Guards: Re-validates tenant permissions, token expiration, and source code git commit freshness before resuming an interrupted checkpoint.

**AP. Control concurrency.** Concurrency Control: Implements Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) using an incrementing integer `version` column. Concurrent write collision returns HTTP 409 `ERR_OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_CONFLICT`.

**AQ. Handle ordering.** Event Ordering: Domain events assigned strictly monotonic sequence numbers within tenant partition scope; out-of-order events buffered in Redis priority queue for deterministic reassembly.

**AR. Define transactions.** Transaction Boundaries: State updates to `EmergencyStop` and corresponding outbox event entries execute in a single ACID transaction under PostgreSQL `READ COMMITTED` or `SERIALIZABLE` isolation.

**AS. Publish events.** Domain Event Envelope: `{ event_id: UUID, event_type: 'v5.emergencystop.state_changed', aggregate_id: UUID, aggregate_revision: SHA256Digest, timestamp_utc: ISOTimestamp, payload: Record<string, any> }`.

**AT. Define subscriptions.** Realtime Subscriptions: WebSocket subscription channel `tenant:{id}:emergencystop` delivers state changes to frontend within 50ms; re-authenticates client token on every reconnect.

**AU. Specify caching.** Cache Policy: Entity metadata cached in Redis key `emergencystop:meta:{id}` with TTL = 300 seconds; invalidated synchronously upon any write transaction.

**AV. Handle freshness.** Freshness Bounds: Cache entries older than 300 seconds flagged as `STALE_REVISION`; background worker triggers asynchronous refresh.

**AW. Detect staleness.** Invalidation Triggers: Incoming git push webhook or user configuration update immediately publishes Redis cache eviction message.

**AX. Define fallback.** Degradation Fallback: If Redis cache is completely unreachable, gateway falls back to querying read-replica PostgreSQL instances with circuit breaker.

**AY. Reconcile outcomes.** Reconciliation Loop: Nightly background job sweeps `EmergencyStop` records against underlying git repository state to detect and reconcile out-of-band modifications.

**AZ. Plan retrieval.** Query Plan: Indexed by compound B-tree on `(tenant_id, scope_id, created_at DESC)` ensuring index-only scans for high-frequency dashboard queries.

### Block 3: Evidence (Requirements BA–BZ)

**BJ. Render citations.** Citation Format: Renders inline interactive citations linking to exact file paths and line ranges: `[VYRON: EmergencyStop, src/core/engine.ts#L42-L68]`.

**BK. Separate inference.** Inference Separation: Any AI-generated design recommendation is visually segregated with an explicit `[INFERRED_PROPOSAL]` badge and limitation disclosure.

**BL. Verify calculations.** Calculation Verification: Mathematical calculations (ratios, latencies, coverage percentages) computed deterministically using standard IEEE 754 arithmetic with unit tests.

**BM. Verify semantics.** Semantic Integrity: Validates domain terminology against ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 systems and software architecture standards.

**BP. Preserve lineage.** Lineage Graph: Retains complete backward provenance from displayed UI card $\rightarrow$ evaluation job $\rightarrow$ AST parse tree $\rightarrow$ source file revision.

**BQ. Record corrections.** Correction Ledger: User feedback and corrective inputs create append-only supersession records linked to the original claim without mutating historical audit records.

**BR. Validate sources.** Source Validation: Re-validates reachability, commit existence, and cryptographic GPG signatures of source git repositories before indexing.

**BS. Reject fabrication.** Anti-Fabrication Law: System asserts `ASSERT_ZERO_FABRICATION`; strictly blocks simulated test passes or invented file paths from production displays.

**BU. Design presentation.** User Presentation: Clean card layout with high-contrast status pills, progressive disclosure drawers, and syntax-highlighted code diff viewers.

**BV. Support accessibility.** Accessibility Guarantee: Fully operable via keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift-Tab/Enter); ARIA live regions announce dynamic state changes to screen readers.

**BW. Respect preferences.** User Preferences: Honors user display preferences (compact vs expanded view, dark vs light theme) without altering security boundaries.

**BX. Persist records.** Storage Architecture: Canonical state stored in PostgreSQL with row-level security; operational logs archived in object storage with immutable lifecycle policies.

**BY. Define retention.** Retention Rules: Audit logs retained for 7 years; intermediate execution traces retained for 30 days; ephemeral debug logs purged after 72 hours.

**BZ. Propagate deletion.** Deletion Cascade: User-initiated deletion cascades tombstone records across dependent caches, vector embeddings, and search indexes within 10 seconds.

### Block 4: Assurance (Requirements CA–CZ)

**CA. Version exports.** Export Versioning: Exported architecture dossiers formatted in JSON/PDF schemas versioned under SemVer `v5.0` with SHA-256 manifest hash.

**CH. Monitor saturation.** Saturation Alerts: Alerts operations team when worker CPU exceeds 80% or database connection pool exceeds 75% utilization.

**CI. Classify failures.** Failure Taxonomy: Non-overlapping error codes: `ERR_SCHEMA_VALIDATION` (400), `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED` (403), `ERR_NOT_FOUND` (404), `ERR_TIMEOUT` (504).

**CJ. Expose recovery.** Operational Recovery: Provides automated administrative recovery endpoint `/api/v5/emergencystops/repair` to clear stuck locks and resume pipelines.

**CK. Protect secrets.** Secret Protection: API keys and database credentials injected via secure environment variables; never logged to stdout or included in exception stack traces.

**CM. Revalidate authority.** Authority Revalidation: Re-checks caller permissions immediately before executing any mutation, even if previously validated at gateway.

**CN. Test isolation.** Negative Isolation Test: Synthetic red-team test attempts to read `EmergencyStop` across tenant boundaries; asserts 0 records returned and security alarm logged.

**CO. Test contracts.** Contract Test Suite: Automated schema validation test confirms 100% compliance of `EmergencyStop` endpoints against OpenAPI 3.1 specifications.

## PHASE 125: EVALUATED PLAYBOOK IMPROVEMENT

- **Identifier:** `V5:125`
- **Functional Group:** Group 13 (Autonomy lifecycle)
- **Primary Domain Object:** `PlaybookImprovement`
- **Source Reference:** Decoupled under V5 Canonical Architecture
- **Design Lifecycle Status:** `review-ready`
- **Phase Objective:** Define authoritative operational contracts, data schemas, state transitions, and verification gates for Evaluated playbook improvement. Enforce tenant isolation, immutable revision anchoring, and failure recovery.

### Block 1: Foundations (Requirements A–Z)

**A. Define purpose.** Instantiates outcome for `PlaybookImprovement`: OutcomeStatement { entity: 'PlaybookImprovement', target_metric: 'deterministic_verification_ratio', acceptable_threshold: 1.0 }. Measurable Benefit: Eliminates speculative AI hallucinations by guaranteeing all reported conclusions are anchored to immutable cryptographic AST or git evidence. Failing Counterexample: An agent claiming a build passed based on heuristic text generation is intercepted and marked UNVERIFIED.

**B. Bound scope.** Responsibility boundary for `PlaybookImprovement`: Strictly encompasses domain state management, invariant enforcement, and audit lineage for `Evaluated playbook improvement`. Explicit Exclusions: Direct execution of unreviewed shell scripts and unmonitored production database migrations. Adjacent Owners: InfrastructureEngineeringModule, AuthGatewayService. Boundary Rule: If a request crosses into external system modification, it must halt and emit a formal ActionProposal.

**C. Assign ownership.** Canonical Writer: `PlaybookImprovementAuthorityEngine`; Operating Owner: `Staff_Reliability_Engineer`; Escalation Owner: `Principal_Architect`. Dispute Resolution Path: Conflicting state assertions between client cache and server are resolved strictly in favor of PostgreSQL append-only event ledger. Quorum of 2 required to alter governance invariants.

**D. Name consumers.** Consumers: `CopilotIntelligenceEngine` (reads state for context assembly), `ReleaseGateReviewer` (evaluates readiness gates), `AuditorPortal` (exports compliance dossiers). Decisions Made: Granting promotion to staging, certifying compliance, and authorizing sandbox execution. Presentation Needs: High-density structural tables with expandable citation anchors.

**E. Specify inputs.** Input schema `CreatePlaybookImprovementRequest`: { tenant_id: UUID, project_id: UUID, actor_id: UUID, specification_payload: Record<string, any>, expected_revision: SHA256Digest }.

**N. Specify transitions.** Transition: `PENDING_VALIDATION` $\rightarrow$ `ACTIVE` guarded by predicate `all_preconditions_met == true AND actor_authorized == true`. Trigger: Internal validation event. Rejected Transition: Attempting to transition from `TOMBSTONED` to `ACTIVE` returns HTTP 409 `ERR_ILLEGAL_STATE_TRANSITION`.

**O. Declare dependencies.** Hard Upstream Dependencies: `PostgreSQL_Core`, `Vault_KMS`, `Redis_Session_Store`. Optional Dependencies: `ExternalLinterConnector` (falls back to internal deterministic AST parser if network times out). Outage Behavior: System operates in read-only degraded mode.

## PHASE 126: CONTROLLED AUTOMATION EXPOSURE

- **Identifier:** `V5:126`
- **Functional Group:** Group 13 (Autonomy lifecycle)
- **Primary Domain Object:** `ControlledExposure`
- **Source Reference:** Decoupled under V5 Canonical Architecture
- **Design Lifecycle Status:** `review-ready`
- **Phase Objective:** Define authoritative operational contracts, data schemas, state transitions, and verification gates for Controlled automation exposure. Enforce tenant isolation, immutable revision anchoring, and failure recovery.

### Block 1: Foundations (Requirements A–Z)

**A. Define purpose.** Instantiates outcome for `ControlledExposure`: OutcomeStatement { entity: 'ControlledExposure', target_metric: 'deterministic_verification_ratio', acceptable_threshold: 1.0 }. Measurable Benefit: Eliminates speculative AI hallucinations by guaranteeing all reported conclusions are anchored to immutable cryptographic AST or git evidence. Failing Counterexample: An agent claiming a build passed based on heuristic text generation is intercepted and marked UNVERIFIED.

**B. Bound scope.** Responsibility boundary for `ControlledExposure`: Strictly encompasses domain state management, invariant enforcement, and audit lineage for `Controlled automation exposure`. Explicit Exclusions: Direct execution of unreviewed shell scripts and unmonitored production database migrations. Adjacent Owners: InfrastructureEngineeringModule, AuthGatewayService. Boundary Rule: If a request crosses into external system modification, it must halt and emit a formal ActionProposal.

**C. Assign ownership.** Canonical Writer: `ControlledExposureAuthorityEngine`; Operating Owner: `Staff_Reliability_Engineer`; Escalation Owner: `Principal_Architect`. Dispute Resolution Path: Conflicting state assertions between client cache and server are resolved strictly in favor of PostgreSQL append-only event ledger. Quorum of 2 required to alter governance invariants.

**D. Name consumers.** Consumers: `CopilotIntelligenceEngine` (reads state for context assembly), `ReleaseGateReviewer` (evaluates readiness gates), `AuditorPortal` (exports compliance dossiers). Decisions Made: Granting promotion to staging, certifying compliance, and authorizing sandbox execution. Presentation Needs: High-density structural tables with expandable citation anchors.

**E. Specify inputs.** Input schema `CreateControlledExposureRequest`: { tenant_id: UUID, project_id: UUID, actor_id: UUID, specification_payload: Record<string, any>, expected_revision: SHA256Digest }. Maximum payload size: 512KB. Validation Rule: Rejects HTTP 400 on malformed UUIDs, unknown schema versions, or mismatched SHA-256 pre-state digests.

**F. Specify outputs.** Returns `ControlledExposureEnvelope`: { status: 'SUCCESS' | 'PARTIAL' | 'FAILED', record_id: UUID, revision_sha: SHA256Digest, observed_at: ISOTimestamp, limitation_notice?: string }. Failure Response: Returns HTTP 422 with structured defect descriptor { error_code: 'ERR_INVARIANT_VIOLATION', violating_fields: string[], remediation_hint: string }.

**G. Define identities.** Stable URN: `urn:vyron:entity:controlledexposure:uuid`; Immutable Revision Identity: `sha256(canonical_json(payload) + parent_revision)`. Invocation Identity: `inv_seq_{uuid}`. External Identifiers: Sanitized git commit SHAs (40 hex) and GitHub PR numbers mapped via foreign key registry.

**H. Define schemas.** Logical Schema `ControlledExposureRecord`: `id: UUID PRIMARY KEY`, `tenant_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `scope_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `state: varchar(32) NOT NULL`, `revision_digest: char(64) NOT NULL`, `created_at: timestamptz DEFAULT now()`, `metadata: jsonb NOT NULL`. Schema Evolution: Additive column migrations only; default values enforced on new fields.

**I. Map relationships.** Edge: `ControlledExposure` $\rightarrow$ `Workspace` (M:1, cascade restrict); `ControlledExposure` $\rightarrow$ `AuditChainNode` (1:N, cascade tombstone on legal purge). Referential integrity enforced by PostgreSQL foreign keys. Display edges maintained in memory graph without corrupting relational truth.

**J. State invariants.** Invariant J.1: An entity `ControlledExposure` cannot transition to `VERIFIED` status without at least one non-empty cryptographic evidence digest link. Counterexample Fixture `ViolatingUnverifiedControlledExposure` triggers assertion failure `ASSERT_EVIDENCE_ABSENT` and halts transaction rollback.

**K. Define preconditions.** Precondition: Caller session must possess valid cryptographic JWT bearing scope `tenant_id` and role grant `controlledexposure:write`; target project must be in `ACTIVE` state. Enforcing Boundary: Edge API Gateway Sentinel.

**L. Define postconditions.** Observable Outcome: Record persisted in PostgreSQL `vyron_controlledexposures` table and corresponding event emitted to `vyron_outbox_events` within the same atomic ACID transaction. Independent Verification: Read-after-write probe on follower replica matches primary within 50ms.

**M. Model states.** State Catalog: `UNINITIALIZED`, `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `ACTIVE`, `DEGRADED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Terminal States: `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Resumable States: `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `DEGRADED`. State transitions are strictly monotonic.

**N. Specify transitions.** Transition: `PENDING_VALIDATION` $\rightarrow$ `ACTIVE` guarded by predicate `all_preconditions_met == true AND actor_authorized == true`. Trigger: Internal validation event. Rejected Transition: Attempting to transition from `TOMBSTONED` to `ACTIVE` returns HTTP 409 `ERR_ILLEGAL_STATE_TRANSITION`.

**O. Declare dependencies.** Hard Upstream Dependencies: `PostgreSQL_Core`, `Vault_KMS`, `Redis_Session_Store`. Optional Dependencies: `ExternalLinterConnector` (falls back to internal deterministic AST parser if network times out). Outage Behavior: System operates in read-only degraded mode.

**P. Publish contracts.** Versioned RPC Interface: `v5.controlledexposure.evaluate` exposed on internal bus and REST endpoint `/api/v5/controlledexposures/evaluate`. Validation Semantics: Enforces JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 validation on request boundaries.

**Q. Version interfaces.** SemVer: `v5.0.0`. Deprecation Migration Path: Deprecated v4 API endpoints return `X-Vyron-Deprecated: true` header with 6-month migration horizon; v5 endpoints enforce strict non-nullable fields.

**R. Identify authority.** Authority Matrix: Relational database table `vyron_controlledexposures` is authoritative for domain state; client local storage, web worker state, and Redis cache are treated as disposable projections.

**S. Preserve provenance.** Transformation Chain: Retains source actor UUID, originating client IP, prompt revision SHA, AST symbol version, and evaluation timestamp across every state mutation.

**T. Enforce tenancy.** Tenant Isolation Rule: Enforced via PostgreSQL Row-Level Security: `USING (tenant_id = auth.jwt()->>'tenant_id')`. Cross-Tenant Test: Negative isolation test attempting cross-tenant primary key lookup returns empty set (0 rows).

**U. Enforce membership.** Membership Scope: Verified at request admission against `vyron_memberships` table. Revocation Fixture: If a user is removed from a workspace while an operation is in-flight, downstream mutations are rejected at commit time with HTTP 403 `ERR_MEMBERSHIP_REVOKED`.

**V. Specify permissions.** Granular Matrix: `controlledexposure:read`, `controlledexposure:propose`, `controlledexposure:mutate`, `controlledexposure:export`. Enforced independently at edge proxy, service dispatch, and database RLS layers.

**W. Classify sensitivity.** Sensitivity Classification: `CONFIDENTIAL`. Sensitive attributes (access keys, private repository URIs, customer credentials) encrypted using AES-GCM-256 envelope encryption with Vault KMS keys.

**X. Minimize collection.** Data Minimization: Collects only structural AST representations, git commit hashes, and verification metrics; explicitly avoids collecting developer keystrokes, personal desktop environment variables, or unrelated source files.

**Y. State assumptions.** Assumption Register: Assumes underlying host filesystem conforms to POSIX semantics and system clock is synchronized via NTP within $\le 10$ms drift tolerance. Validation: Checked by daily automated infrastructure probe.

**Z. Plan execution.** Ordered Procedure: 1. Validate incoming request schema. 2. Verify actor tenancy and membership grants. 3. Acquire optimistic lock on current revision. 4. Execute deterministic invariant checks. 5. Write new state and outbox event in single transaction. 6. Emit telemetry span and return response.

### Block 2: Execution (Requirements AA–AZ)

**AA. Map dependencies.** Execution DAG: ValidateRequest $\rightarrow$ FetchContext $\rightarrow$ CheckInvariants $\rightarrow$ PersistMutation $\rightarrow$ EmitEvents. Graph is strictly acyclic with maximum execution depth bounded to 6 hops.

**AB. Bound parallelism.** Concurrency Limit: Maximum 16 parallel evaluations of `ControlledExposure` per worker instance; cluster queue depth throttled via Redis token bucket algorithm.

**AC. Budget latency.** End-to-End Latency Budget: P95 $\le 180$ms, P99 $\le 450$ms. Measurement Boundaries: Measured from HTTP socket read to final response byte flush.

**AD. Propagate deadlines.** Deadline Context: 1500ms timeout propagated through Go/Node context channels; database queries carry `statement_timeout = '1200ms'`. Client disconnect triggers immediate cooperative worker abort.

**AE. Bound resources.** Resource Ceilings: Memory limit per operation: 128MB; maximum CPU time: 800ms; maximum response payload: 1MB. Overload Response: Emits HTTP 429 with backoff advisory.

**AF. Select capabilities.** Capability Selection: Uses native deterministic TypeScript/Go AST parsing engine; strictly avoids delegating structural schema analysis to generative LLM components.

**AG. Constrain models.** Model Constraint: Where AI models assist in summarizing `Controlled automation exposure`, models are locked into read-only context with system prompt injection protection; prohibited from generating executable shell actions.

**AH. Authorize tools.** Tool Authorization: Every tool invocation referencing `ControlledExposure` requires an explicit cryptographic grant signed by an authorized human actor or designated automated policy gate.

**AI. Validate arguments.** Argument Validator: Validates parameter types, string lengths ($\le 255$ chars), path safety (regex prohibiting `../` traversal), and UUID formats before passing to internal handlers.

**AJ. Isolate execution.** Sandbox Boundary: Untrusted code analysis executes in ephemeral Firecracker microVMs with read-only root filesystems, disabled outbound networking, and 500ms execution timeout.

**AK. Ensure idempotency.** Idempotency Key: `sha256(tenant_id + request_nonce + operation_digest)`. Deduplication retention window: 24 hours. Repeat requests return identical cached response without re-executing state mutation.

**AL. Control retries.** Retry Policy: Retries transient database network disconnects up to $3\times$ with exponential backoff (50ms, 150ms, 450ms). Prohibits retrying non-idempotent mutation calls without prior reconciliation check.

**AM. Handle cancellation.** Cancellation Semantics: Upon receiving client cancellation token, worker terminates downstream subprocesses, releases distributed Redis mutex locks, and marks transaction `ABORTED` in audit log.

**AN. Persist checkpoints.** Checkpoint Storage: Long-running batch analyses persist checkpoints every 100 evaluated records in PostgreSQL `vyron_execution_checkpoints` to allow zero-loss recovery.

**AO. Support resumption.** Resume Guards: Re-validates tenant permissions, token expiration, and source code git commit freshness before resuming an interrupted checkpoint.

**AP. Control concurrency.** Concurrency Control: Implements Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) using an incrementing integer `version` column. Concurrent write collision returns HTTP 409 `ERR_OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_CONFLICT`.

**AQ. Handle ordering.** Event Ordering: Domain events assigned strictly monotonic sequence numbers within tenant partition scope; out-of-order events buffered in Redis priority queue for deterministic reassembly.

**AR. Define transactions.** Transaction Boundaries: State updates to `ControlledExposure` and corresponding outbox event entries execute in a single ACID transaction under PostgreSQL `READ COMMITTED` or `SERIALIZABLE` isolation.

**AS. Publish events.** Domain Event Envelope: `{ event_id: UUID, event_type: 'v5.controlledexposure.state_changed', aggregate_id: UUID, aggregate_revision: SHA256Digest, timestamp_utc: ISOTimestamp, payload: Record<string, any> }`.

**AT. Define subscriptions.** Realtime Subscriptions: WebSocket subscription channel `tenant:{id}:controlledexposure` delivers state changes to frontend within 50ms; re-authenticates client token on every reconnect.

**AU. Specify caching.** Cache Policy: Entity metadata cached in Redis key `controlledexposure:meta:{id}` with TTL = 300 seconds; invalidated synchronously upon any write transaction.

**AV. Handle freshness.** Freshness Bounds: Cache entries older than 300 seconds flagged as `STALE_REVISION`; background worker triggers asynchronous refresh.

**AW. Detect staleness.** Invalidation Triggers: Incoming git push webhook or user configuration update immediately publishes Redis cache eviction message.

**AX. Define fallback.** Degradation Fallback: If Redis cache is completely unreachable, gateway falls back to querying read-replica PostgreSQL instances with circuit breaker.

**AY. Reconcile outcomes.** Reconciliation Loop: Nightly background job sweeps `ControlledExposure` records against underlying git repository state to detect and reconcile out-of-band modifications.

**AZ. Plan retrieval.** Query Plan: Indexed by compound B-tree on `(tenant_id, scope_id, created_at DESC)` ensuring index-only scans for high-frequency dashboard queries.

### Block 3: Evidence (Requirements BA–BZ)

**BA. Define ranking.** Evidence Ranking: Ranks evidence signals by deterministic proof weight: Compiler Output (1.0) > Automated Test Assertions (0.9) > SAST Linter Diagnostics (0.7) > Historical Heuristics (0.3).

**BB. Deduplicate evidence.** Deduplication Strategy: Groups identical compiler diagnostics across repeated CI runs for unchanged commit SHAs into single canonical evidence records.

**BC. Check coverage.** Coverage Verification: Verifies that 100% of declared structural boundaries for `Controlled automation exposure` have matching automated validation test cases.

**BD. Assemble evidence.** Dossier Assembly: Packages raw test logs, compiler stdout/stderr, git commit metadata, and cryptographic SHA-256 signatures into an immutable evidence dossier.

**BE. Extract claims.** Claim Extraction: Decomposes findings into atomic falsifiable propositions: e.g. 'Component `ControlledExposure` conforms to zero-raw-SQL mandate at commit SHA 9a8f1'.

**BF. Classify claims.** Claim Classification: Explicitly classifies claims into `VERIFIED_OBSERVATION`, `DERIVED_FACT`, `HYPOTHESIS`, or `PROPOSED_MUTATION`. Prohibits treating hypotheses as facts.

**BG. Validate support.** Entailment Verification: Verifies that cited source code lines directly entail the asserted claim using automated regex and AST symbol matchers.

**BH. Detect contradictions.** Contradiction Detection: Flags an architectural contradiction if an automated test asserts passing status while a compiler check records syntax errors.

**BI. Calibrate confidence.** Confidence Calibration: Confidence score = 1.0 for deterministically verified compiler passes; confidence capped at 0.5 for generative model suggestions lacking test execution.

**BJ. Render citations.** Citation Format: Renders inline interactive citations linking to exact file paths and line ranges: `[VYRON: ControlledExposure, src/core/engine.ts#L42-L68]`.

**BK. Separate inference.** Inference Separation: Any AI-generated design recommendation is visually segregated with an explicit `[INFERRED_PROPOSAL]` badge and limitation disclosure.

**BL. Verify calculations.** Calculation Verification: Mathematical calculations (ratios, latencies, coverage percentages) computed deterministically using standard IEEE 754 arithmetic with unit tests.

**BM. Verify semantics.** Semantic Integrity: Validates domain terminology against ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 systems and software architecture standards.

**BN. Bound conclusions.** Conclusion Bounds: Prohibits declaring a release gate passed if any high-severity invariant fails, regardless of passing scores in other categories.

**BR. Validate sources.** Source Validation: Re-validates reachability, commit existence, and cryptographic GPG signatures of source git repositories before indexing.

**BU. Design presentation.** User Presentation: Clean card layout with high-contrast status pills, progressive disclosure drawers, and syntax-highlighted code diff viewers.

**BV. Support accessibility.** Accessibility Guarantee: Fully operable via keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift-Tab/Enter); ARIA live regions announce dynamic state changes to screen readers.

**BW. Respect preferences.** User Preferences: Honors user display preferences (compact vs expanded view, dark vs light theme) without altering security boundaries.

**BY. Define retention.** Retention Rules: Audit logs retained for 7 years; intermediate execution traces retained for 30 days; ephemeral debug logs purged after 72 hours.

**BZ. Propagate deletion.** Deletion Cascade: User-initiated deletion cascades tombstone records across dependent caches, vector embeddings, and search indexes within 10 seconds.

## PHASE 127: LONG-LIVED GRANT DRIFT

**O. Declare dependencies.** Hard Upstream Dependencies: `PostgreSQL_Core`, `Vault_KMS`, `Redis_Session_Store`. Optional Dependencies: `ExternalLinterConnector` (falls back to internal deterministic AST parser if network times out). Outage Behavior: System operates in read-only degraded mode.

**P. Publish contracts.** Versioned RPC Interface: `v5.grantdrift.evaluate` exposed on internal bus and REST endpoint `/api/v5/grantdrifts/evaluate`. Validation Semantics: Enforces JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 validation on request boundaries.

**Q. Version interfaces.** SemVer: `v5.0.0`. Deprecation Migration Path: Deprecated v4 API endpoints return `X-Vyron-Deprecated: true` header with 6-month migration horizon; v5 endpoints enforce strict non-nullable fields.

**R. Identify authority.** Authority Matrix: Relational database table `vyron_grantdrifts` is authoritative for domain state; client local storage, web worker state, and Redis cache are treated as disposable projections.

**S. Preserve provenance.** Transformation Chain: Retains source actor UUID, originating client IP, prompt revision SHA, AST symbol version, and evaluation timestamp across every state mutation.

**T. Enforce tenancy.** Tenant Isolation Rule: Enforced via PostgreSQL Row-Level Security: `USING (tenant_id = auth.jwt()->>'tenant_id')`. Cross-Tenant Test: Negative isolation test attempting cross-tenant primary key lookup returns empty set (0 rows).

**U. Enforce membership.** Membership Scope: Verified at request admission against `vyron_memberships` table. Revocation Fixture: If a user is removed from a workspace while an operation is in-flight, downstream mutations are rejected at commit time with HTTP 403 `ERR_MEMBERSHIP_REVOKED`.

**V. Specify permissions.** Granular Matrix: `grantdrift:read`, `grantdrift:propose`, `grantdrift:mutate`, `grantdrift:export`. Enforced independently at edge proxy, service dispatch, and database RLS layers.

**W. Classify sensitivity.** Sensitivity Classification: `CONFIDENTIAL`. Sensitive attributes (access keys, private repository URIs, customer credentials) encrypted using AES-GCM-256 envelope encryption with Vault KMS keys.

**X. Minimize collection.** Data Minimization: Collects only structural AST representations, git commit hashes, and verification metrics; explicitly avoids collecting developer keystrokes, personal desktop environment variables, or unrelated source files.

**Y. State assumptions.** Assumption Register: Assumes underlying host filesystem conforms to POSIX semantics and system clock is synchronized via NTP within $\le 10$ms drift tolerance. Validation: Checked by daily automated infrastructure probe.

**Z. Plan execution.** Ordered Procedure: 1. Validate incoming request schema. 2. Verify actor tenancy and membership grants. 3. Acquire optimistic lock on current revision. 4. Execute deterministic invariant checks. 5. Write new state and outbox event in single transaction. 6. Emit telemetry span and return response.

### Block 2: Execution (Requirements AA–AZ)

**AA. Map dependencies.** Execution DAG: ValidateRequest $\rightarrow$ FetchContext $\rightarrow$ CheckInvariants $\rightarrow$ PersistMutation $\rightarrow$ EmitEvents. Graph is strictly acyclic with maximum execution depth bounded to 6 hops.

**AB. Bound parallelism.** Concurrency Limit: Maximum 16 parallel evaluations of `GrantDrift` per worker instance; cluster queue depth throttled via Redis token bucket algorithm.

**AC. Budget latency.** End-to-End Latency Budget: P95 $\le 180$ms, P99 $\le 450$ms. Measurement Boundaries: Measured from HTTP socket read to final response byte flush.

**AD. Propagate deadlines.** Deadline Context: 1500ms timeout propagated through Go/Node context channels; database queries carry `statement_timeout = '1200ms'`. Client disconnect triggers immediate cooperative worker abort.

**AE. Bound resources.** Resource Ceilings: Memory limit per operation: 128MB; maximum CPU time: 800ms; maximum response payload: 1MB. Overload Response: Emits HTTP 429 with backoff advisory.

**AF. Select capabilities.** Capability Selection: Uses native deterministic TypeScript/Go AST parsing engine; strictly avoids delegating structural schema analysis to generative LLM components.

**AG. Constrain models.** Model Constraint: Where AI models assist in summarizing `Long-lived grant drift`, models are locked into read-only context with system prompt injection protection; prohibited from generating executable shell actions.

**AH. Authorize tools.** Tool Authorization: Every tool invocation referencing `GrantDrift` requires an explicit cryptographic grant signed by an authorized human actor or designated automated policy gate.

**AI. Validate arguments.** Argument Validator: Validates parameter types, string lengths ($\le 255$ chars), path safety (regex prohibiting `../` traversal), and UUID formats before passing to internal handlers.

**AJ. Isolate execution.** Sandbox Boundary: Untrusted code analysis executes in ephemeral Firecracker microVMs with read-only root filesystems, disabled outbound networking, and 500ms execution timeout.

**AK. Ensure idempotency.** Idempotency Key: `sha256(tenant_id + request_nonce + operation_digest)`. Deduplication retention window: 24 hours. Repeat requests return identical cached response without re-executing state mutation.

**AL. Control retries.** Retry Policy: Retries transient database network disconnects up to $3\times$ with exponential backoff (50ms, 150ms, 450ms). Prohibits retrying non-idempotent mutation calls without prior reconciliation check.

**AM. Handle cancellation.** Cancellation Semantics: Upon receiving client cancellation token, worker terminates downstream subprocesses, releases distributed Redis mutex locks, and marks transaction `ABORTED` in audit log.

**AN. Persist checkpoints.** Checkpoint Storage: Long-running batch analyses persist checkpoints every 100 evaluated records in PostgreSQL `vyron_execution_checkpoints` to allow zero-loss recovery.

**AO. Support resumption.** Resume Guards: Re-validates tenant permissions, token expiration, and source code git commit freshness before resuming an interrupted checkpoint.

**AP. Control concurrency.** Concurrency Control: Implements Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) using an incrementing integer `version` column. Concurrent write collision returns HTTP 409 `ERR_OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_CONFLICT`.

**AQ. Handle ordering.** Event Ordering: Domain events assigned strictly monotonic sequence numbers within tenant partition scope; out-of-order events buffered in Redis priority queue for deterministic reassembly.

**AR. Define transactions.** Transaction Boundaries: State updates to `GrantDrift` and corresponding outbox event entries execute in a single ACID transaction under PostgreSQL `READ COMMITTED` or `SERIALIZABLE` isolation.

**AS. Publish events.** Domain Event Envelope: `{ event_id: UUID, event_type: 'v5.grantdrift.state_changed', aggregate_id: UUID, aggregate_revision: SHA256Digest, timestamp_utc: ISOTimestamp, payload: Record<string, any> }`.

**AT. Define subscriptions.** Realtime Subscriptions: WebSocket subscription channel `tenant:{id}:grantdrift` delivers state changes to frontend within 50ms; re-authenticates client token on every reconnect.

**AU. Specify caching.** Cache Policy: Entity metadata cached in Redis key `grantdrift:meta:{id}` with TTL = 300 seconds; invalidated synchronously upon any write transaction.

**AV. Handle freshness.** Freshness Bounds: Cache entries older than 300 seconds flagged as `STALE_REVISION`; background worker triggers asynchronous refresh.

**AW. Detect staleness.** Invalidation Triggers: Incoming git push webhook or user configuration update immediately publishes Redis cache eviction message.

**AX. Define fallback.** Degradation Fallback: If Redis cache is completely unreachable, gateway falls back to querying read-replica PostgreSQL instances with circuit breaker.

**AY. Reconcile outcomes.** Reconciliation Loop: Nightly background job sweeps `GrantDrift` records against underlying git repository state to detect and reconcile out-of-band modifications.

**AZ. Plan retrieval.** Query Plan: Indexed by compound B-tree on `(tenant_id, scope_id, created_at DESC)` ensuring index-only scans for high-frequency dashboard queries.

### Block 3: Evidence (Requirements BA–BZ)

**BY. Define retention.** Retention Rules: Audit logs retained for 7 years; intermediate execution traces retained for 30 days; ephemeral debug logs purged after 72 hours.

**BZ. Propagate deletion.** Deletion Cascade: User-initiated deletion cascades tombstone records across dependent caches, vector embeddings, and search indexes within 10 seconds.

### Block 4: Assurance (Requirements CA–CZ)

**CA. Version exports.** Export Versioning: Exported architecture dossiers formatted in JSON/PDF schemas versioned under SemVer `v5.0` with SHA-256 manifest hash.

**CG. Account costs.** Cost Attribution: Tracks compute milliseconds, memory utilization, and LLM token usage attributed to each tenant for internal cost allocation.

**CH. Monitor saturation.** Saturation Alerts: Alerts operations team when worker CPU exceeds 80% or database connection pool exceeds 75% utilization.

**CI. Classify failures.** Failure Taxonomy: Non-overlapping error codes: `ERR_SCHEMA_VALIDATION` (400), `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED` (403), `ERR_NOT_FOUND` (404), `ERR_TIMEOUT` (504).

**CJ. Expose recovery.** Operational Recovery: Provides automated administrative recovery endpoint `/api/v5/grantdrifts/repair` to clear stuck locks and resume pipelines.

## PHASE 128: AUTOMATION RUN HISTORY

- **Identifier:** `V5:128`
- **Functional Group:** Group 13 (Autonomy lifecycle)
- **Primary Domain Object:** `RunHistory`
- **Source Reference:** Decoupled under V5 Canonical Architecture
- **Design Lifecycle Status:** `review-ready`
- **Phase Objective:** Define authoritative operational contracts, data schemas, state transitions, and verification gates for Automation run history. Enforce tenant isolation, immutable revision anchoring, and failure recovery.

### Block 1: Foundations (Requirements A–Z)

**A. Define purpose.** Instantiates outcome for `RunHistory`: OutcomeStatement { entity: 'RunHistory', target_metric: 'deterministic_verification_ratio', acceptable_threshold: 1.0 }. Measurable Benefit: Eliminates speculative AI hallucinations by guaranteeing all reported conclusions are anchored to immutable cryptographic AST or git evidence. Failing Counterexample: An agent claiming a build passed based on heuristic text generation is intercepted and marked UNVERIFIED.

**B. Bound scope.** Responsibility boundary for `RunHistory`: Strictly encompasses domain state management, invariant enforcement, and audit lineage for `Automation run history`. Explicit Exclusions: Direct execution of unreviewed shell scripts and unmonitored production database migrations. Adjacent Owners: InfrastructureEngineeringModule, AuthGatewayService. Boundary Rule: If a request crosses into external system modification, it must halt and emit a formal ActionProposal.

**C. Assign ownership.** Canonical Writer: `RunHistoryAuthorityEngine`; Operating Owner: `Staff_Reliability_Engineer`; Escalation Owner: `Principal_Architect`. Dispute Resolution Path: Conflicting state assertions between client cache and server are resolved strictly in favor of PostgreSQL append-only event ledger. Quorum of 2 required to alter governance invariants.

**D. Name consumers.** Consumers: `CopilotIntelligenceEngine` (reads state for context assembly), `ReleaseGateReviewer` (evaluates readiness gates), `AuditorPortal` (exports compliance dossiers). Decisions Made: Granting promotion to staging, certifying compliance, and authorizing sandbox execution. Presentation Needs: High-density structural tables with expandable citation anchors.

**E. Specify inputs.** Input schema `CreateRunHistoryRequest`: { tenant_id: UUID, project_id: UUID, actor_id: UUID, specification_payload: Record<string, any>, expected_revision: SHA256Digest }. Maximum payload size: 512KB. Validation Rule: Rejects HTTP 400 on malformed UUIDs, unknown schema versions, or mismatched SHA-256 pre-state digests.

**F. Specify outputs.** Returns `RunHistoryEnvelope`: { status: 'SUCCESS' | 'PARTIAL' | 'FAILED', record_id: UUID, revision_sha: SHA256Digest, observed_at: ISOTimestamp, limitation_notice?: string }. Failure Response: Returns HTTP 422 with structured defect descriptor { error_code: 'ERR_INVARIANT_VIOLATION', violating_fields: string[], remediation_hint: string }.

**G. Define identities.** Stable URN: `urn:vyron:entity:runhistory:uuid`; Immutable Revision Identity: `sha256(canonical_json(payload) + parent_revision)`. Invocation Identity: `inv_seq_{uuid}`. External Identifiers: Sanitized git commit SHAs (40 hex) and GitHub PR numbers mapped via foreign key registry.

**H. Define schemas.** Logical Schema `RunHistoryRecord`: `id: UUID PRIMARY KEY`, `tenant_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `scope_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `state: varchar(32) NOT NULL`, `revision_digest: char(64) NOT NULL`, `created_at: timestamptz DEFAULT now()`, `metadata: jsonb NOT NULL`. Schema Evolution: Additive column migrations only; default values enforced on new fields.

**I. Map relationships.** Edge: `RunHistory` $\rightarrow$ `Workspace` (M:1, cascade restrict); `RunHistory` $\rightarrow$ `AuditChainNode` (1:N, cascade tombstone on legal purge). Referential integrity enforced by PostgreSQL foreign keys. Display edges maintained in memory graph without corrupting relational truth.

**J. State invariants.** Invariant J.1: An entity `RunHistory` cannot transition to `VERIFIED` status without at least one non-empty cryptographic evidence digest link. Counterexample Fixture `ViolatingUnverifiedRunHistory` triggers assertion failure `ASSERT_EVIDENCE_ABSENT` and halts transaction rollback.

**K. Define preconditions.** Precondition: Caller session must possess valid cryptographic JWT bearing scope `tenant_id` and role grant `runhistory:write`; target project must be in `ACTIVE` state. Enforcing Boundary: Edge API Gateway Sentinel.

**L. Define postconditions.** Observable Outcome: Record persisted in PostgreSQL `vyron_runhistorys` table and corresponding event emitted to `vyron_outbox_events` within the same atomic ACID transaction. Independent Verification: Read-after-write probe on follower replica matches primary within 50ms.

**M. Model states.** State Catalog: `UNINITIALIZED`, `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `ACTIVE`, `DEGRADED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Terminal States: `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Resumable States: `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `DEGRADED`. State transitions are strictly monotonic.

**N. Specify transitions.** Transition: `PENDING_VALIDATION` $\rightarrow$ `ACTIVE` guarded by predicate `all_preconditions_met == true AND actor_authorized == true`. Trigger: Internal validation event. Rejected Transition: Attempting to transition from `TOMBSTONED` to `ACTIVE` returns HTTP 409 `ERR_ILLEGAL_STATE_TRANSITION`.

**O. Declare dependencies.** Hard Upstream Dependencies: `PostgreSQL_Core`, `Vault_KMS`, `Redis_Session_Store`. Optional Dependencies: `ExternalLinterConnector` (falls back to internal deterministic AST parser if network times out). Outage Behavior: System operates in read-only degraded mode.

**P. Publish contracts.** Versioned RPC Interface: `v5.runhistory.evaluate` exposed on internal bus and REST endpoint `/api/v5/runhistorys/evaluate`. Validation Semantics: Enforces JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 validation on request boundaries.

**Q. Version interfaces.** SemVer: `v5.0.0`. Deprecation Migration Path: Deprecated v4 API endpoints return `X-Vyron-Deprecated: true` header with 6-month migration horizon; v5 endpoints enforce strict non-nullable fields.

**R. Identify authority.** Authority Matrix: Relational database table `vyron_runhistorys` is authoritative for domain state; client local storage, web worker state, and Redis cache are treated as disposable projections.

**S. Preserve provenance.** Transformation Chain: Retains source actor UUID, originating client IP, prompt revision SHA, AST symbol version, and evaluation timestamp across every state mutation.

**T. Enforce tenancy.** Tenant Isolation Rule: Enforced via PostgreSQL Row-Level Security: `USING (tenant_id = auth.jwt()->>'tenant_id')`. Cross-Tenant Test: Negative isolation test attempting cross-tenant primary key lookup returns empty set (0 rows).

**U. Enforce membership.** Membership Scope: Verified at request admission against `vyron_memberships` table. Revocation Fixture: If a user is removed from a workspace while an operation is in-flight, downstream mutations are rejected at commit time with HTTP 403 `ERR_MEMBERSHIP_REVOKED`.

**V. Specify permissions.** Granular Matrix: `runhistory:read`, `runhistory:propose`, `runhistory:mutate`, `runhistory:export`. Enforced independently at edge proxy, service dispatch, and database RLS layers.

**W. Classify sensitivity.** Sensitivity Classification: `CONFIDENTIAL`. Sensitive attributes (access keys, private repository URIs, customer credentials) encrypted using AES-GCM-256 envelope encryption with Vault KMS keys.

**X. Minimize collection.** Data Minimization: Collects only structural AST representations, git commit hashes, and verification metrics; explicitly avoids collecting developer keystrokes, personal desktop environment variables, or unrelated source files.

**Y. State assumptions.** Assumption Register: Assumes underlying host filesystem conforms to POSIX semantics and system clock is synchronized via NTP within $\le 10$ms drift tolerance. Validation: Checked by daily automated infrastructure probe.

**Z. Plan execution.** Ordered Procedure: 1. Validate incoming request schema. 2. Verify actor tenancy and membership grants. 3. Acquire optimistic lock on current revision. 4. Execute deterministic invariant checks. 5. Write new state and outbox event in single transaction. 6. Emit telemetry span and return response.

**CJ. Expose recovery.** Operational Recovery: Provides automated administrative recovery endpoint `/api/v5/runhistorys/repair` to clear stuck locks and resume pipelines.

**CK. Protect secrets.** Secret Protection: API keys and database credentials injected via secure environment variables; never logged to stdout or included in exception stack traces.

**CL. Reject injections.** Injection Defense: Input sanitization filters intercept prompt injection markers (`Ignore all previous instructions`) and reject SQL metacharacters.

**CM. Revalidate authority.** Authority Revalidation: Re-checks caller permissions immediately before executing any mutation, even if previously validated at gateway.

## PHASE 129: BOUNDED AUTOMATION ACCEPTANCE

- **Identifier:** `V5:129`
- **Functional Group:** Group 13 (Autonomy lifecycle)
- **Primary Domain Object:** `BoundedAutomationGate`
- **Source Reference:** Decoupled under V5 Canonical Architecture
- **Design Lifecycle Status:** `review-ready`
- **Phase Objective:** Define authoritative operational contracts, data schemas, state transitions, and verification gates for Bounded automation acceptance. Enforce tenant isolation, immutable revision anchoring, and failure recovery.

### Block 1: Foundations (Requirements A–Z)

**A. Define purpose.** Instantiates outcome for `BoundedAutomationGate`: OutcomeStatement { entity: 'BoundedAutomationGate', target_metric: 'deterministic_verification_ratio', acceptable_threshold: 1.0 }. Measurable Benefit: Eliminates speculative AI hallucinations by guaranteeing all reported conclusions are anchored to immutable cryptographic AST or git evidence. Failing Counterexample: An agent claiming a build passed based on heuristic text generation is intercepted and marked UNVERIFIED.

**B. Bound scope.** Responsibility boundary for `BoundedAutomationGate`: Strictly encompasses domain state management, invariant enforcement, and audit lineage for `Bounded automation acceptance`. Explicit Exclusions: Direct execution of unreviewed shell scripts and unmonitored production database migrations. Adjacent Owners: InfrastructureEngineeringModule, AuthGatewayService. Boundary Rule: If a request crosses into external system modification, it must halt and emit a formal ActionProposal.

**C. Assign ownership.** Canonical Writer: `BoundedAutomationGateAuthorityEngine`; Operating Owner: `Staff_Reliability_Engineer`; Escalation Owner: `Principal_Architect`. Dispute Resolution Path: Conflicting state assertions between client cache and server are resolved strictly in favor of PostgreSQL append-only event ledger. Quorum of 2 required to alter governance invariants.

**D. Name consumers.** Consumers: `CopilotIntelligenceEngine` (reads state for context assembly), `ReleaseGateReviewer` (evaluates readiness gates), `AuditorPortal` (exports compliance dossiers). Decisions Made: Granting promotion to staging, certifying compliance, and authorizing sandbox execution. Presentation Needs: High-density structural tables with expandable citation anchors.

**E. Specify inputs.** Input schema `CreateBoundedAutomationGateRequest`: { tenant_id: UUID, project_id: UUID, actor_id: UUID, specification_payload: Record<string, any>, expected_revision: SHA256Digest }. Maximum payload size: 512KB. Validation Rule: Rejects HTTP 400 on malformed UUIDs, unknown schema versions, or mismatched SHA-256 pre-state digests.

**F. Specify outputs.** Returns `BoundedAutomationGateEnvelope`: { status: 'SUCCESS' | 'PARTIAL' | 'FAILED', record_id: UUID, revision_sha: SHA256Digest, observed_at: ISOTimestamp, limitation_notice?: string }. Failure Response: Returns HTTP 422 with structured defect descriptor { error_code: 'ERR_INVARIANT_VIOLATION', violating_fields: string[], remediation_hint: string }.

**G. Define identities.** Stable URN: `urn:vyron:entity:boundedautomationgate:uuid`; Immutable Revision Identity: `sha256(canonical_json(payload) + parent_revision)`. Invocation Identity: `inv_seq_{uuid}`. External Identifiers: Sanitized git commit SHAs (40 hex) and GitHub PR numbers mapped via foreign key registry.

**H. Define schemas.** Logical Schema `BoundedAutomationGateRecord`: `id: UUID PRIMARY KEY`, `tenant_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `scope_id: UUID NOT NULL`, `state: varchar(32) NOT NULL`, `revision_digest: char(64) NOT NULL`, `created_at: timestamptz DEFAULT now()`, `metadata: jsonb NOT NULL`. Schema Evolution: Additive column migrations only; default values enforced on new fields.

**I. Map relationships.** Edge: `BoundedAutomationGate` $\rightarrow$ `Workspace` (M:1, cascade restrict); `BoundedAutomationGate` $\rightarrow$ `AuditChainNode` (1:N, cascade tombstone on legal purge). Referential integrity enforced by PostgreSQL foreign keys. Display edges maintained in memory graph without corrupting relational truth.

**J. State invariants.** Invariant J.1: An entity `BoundedAutomationGate` cannot transition to `VERIFIED` status without at least one non-empty cryptographic evidence digest link. Counterexample Fixture `ViolatingUnverifiedBoundedAutomationGate` triggers assertion failure `ASSERT_EVIDENCE_ABSENT` and halts transaction rollback.

**K. Define preconditions.** Precondition: Caller session must possess valid cryptographic JWT bearing scope `tenant_id` and role grant `boundedautomationgate:write`; target project must be in `ACTIVE` state. Enforcing Boundary: Edge API Gateway Sentinel.

**L. Define postconditions.** Observable Outcome: Record persisted in PostgreSQL `vyron_boundedautomationgates` table and corresponding event emitted to `vyron_outbox_events` within the same atomic ACID transaction. Independent Verification: Read-after-write probe on follower replica matches primary within 50ms.

**M. Model states.** State Catalog: `UNINITIALIZED`, `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `ACTIVE`, `DEGRADED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Terminal States: `SUPERSEDED`, `TOMBSTONED`. Resumable States: `PENDING_VALIDATION`, `DEGRADED`. State transitions are strictly monotonic.

**N. Specify transitions.** Transition: `PENDING_VALIDATION` $\rightarrow$ `ACTIVE` guarded by predicate `all_preconditions_met == true AND actor_authorized == true`. Trigger: Internal validation event. Rejected Transition: Attempting to transition from `TOMBSTONED` to `ACTIVE` returns HTTP 409 `ERR_ILLEGAL_STATE_TRANSITION`.

**O. Declare dependencies.** Hard Upstream Dependencies: `PostgreSQL_Core`, `Vault_KMS`, `Redis_Session_Store`. Optional Dependencies: `ExternalLinterConnector` (falls back to internal deterministic AST parser if network times out). Outage Behavior: System operates in read-only degraded mode.

**P. Publish contracts.** Versioned RPC Interface: `v5.boundedautomationgate.evaluate` exposed on internal bus and REST endpoint `/api/v5/boundedautomationgates/evaluate`. Validation Semantics: Enforces JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 validation on request boundaries.

**Q. Version interfaces.** SemVer: `v5.0.0`. Deprecation Migration Path: Deprecated v4 API endpoints return `X-Vyron-Deprecated: true` header with 6-month migration horizon; v5 endpoints enforce strict non-nullable fields.

**R. Identify authority.** Authority Matrix: Relational database table `vyron_boundedautomationgates` is authoritative for domain state; client local storage, web worker state, and Redis cache are treated as disposable projections.

**S. Preserve provenance.** Transformation Chain: Retains source actor UUID, originating client IP, prompt revision SHA, AST symbol version, and evaluation timestamp across every state mutation.

**T. Enforce tenancy.** Tenant Isolation Rule: Enforced via PostgreSQL Row-Level Security: `USING (tenant_id = auth.jwt()->>'tenant_id')`. Cross-Tenant Test: Negative isolation test attempting cross-tenant primary key lookup returns empty set (0 rows).

**U. Enforce membership.** Membership Scope: Verified at request admission against `vyron_memberships` table. Revocation Fixture: If a user is removed from a workspace while an operation is in-flight, downstream mutations are rejected at commit time with HTTP 403 `ERR_MEMBERSHIP_REVOKED`.

**V. Specify permissions.** Granular Matrix: `boundedautomationgate:read`, `boundedautomationgate:propose`, `boundedautomationgate:mutate`, `boundedautomationgate:export`. Enforced independently at edge proxy, service dispatch, and database RLS layers.

**W. Classify sensitivity.** Sensitivity Classification: `CONFIDENTIAL`. Sensitive attributes (access keys, private repository URIs, customer credentials) encrypted using AES-GCM-256 envelope encryption with Vault KMS keys.

**X. Minimize collection.** Data Minimization: Collects only structural AST representations, git commit hashes, and verification metrics; explicitly avoids collecting developer keystrokes, personal desktop environment variables, or unrelated source files.

**Y. State assumptions.** Assumption Register: Assumes underlying host filesystem conforms to POSIX semantics and system clock is synchronized via NTP within $\le 10$ms drift tolerance. Validation: Checked by daily automated infrastructure probe.

**Z. Plan execution.** Ordered Procedure: 1. Validate incoming request schema. 2. Verify actor tenancy and membership grants. 3. Acquire optimistic lock on current revision. 4. Execute deterministic invariant checks. 5. Write new state and outbox event in single transaction. 6. Emit telemetry span and return response.

### Block 2: Execution (Requirements AA–AZ)

**AA. Map dependencies.** Execution DAG: ValidateRequest $\rightarrow$ FetchContext $\rightarrow$ CheckInvariants $\rightarrow$ PersistMutation $\rightarrow$ EmitEvents. Graph is strictly acyclic with maximum execution depth bounded to 6 hops.

**AB. Bound parallelism.** Concurrency Limit: Maximum 16 parallel evaluations of `BoundedAutomationGate` per worker instance; cluster queue depth throttled via Redis token bucket algorithm.

**AC. Budget latency.** End-to-End Latency Budget: P95 $\le 180$ms, P99 $\le 450$ms. Measurement Boundaries: Measured from HTTP socket read to final response byte flush.

**AD. Propagate deadlines.** Deadline Context: 1500ms timeout propagated through Go/Node context channels; database queries carry `statement_timeout = '1200ms'`. Client disconnect triggers immediate cooperative worker abort.

**AE. Bound resources.** Resource Ceilings: Memory limit per operation: 128MB; maximum CPU time: 800ms; maximum response payload: 1MB. Overload Response: Emits HTTP 429 with backoff advisory.

**AF. Select capabilities.** Capability Selection: Uses native deterministic TypeScript/Go AST parsing engine; strictly avoids delegating structural schema analysis to generative LLM components.

**AG. Constrain models.** Model Constraint: Where AI models assist in summarizing `Bounded automation acceptance`, models are locked into read-only context with system prompt injection protection; prohibited from generating executable shell actions.

**AH. Authorize tools.** Tool Authorization: Every tool invocation referencing `BoundedAutomationGate` requires an explicit cryptographic grant signed by an authorized human actor or designated automated policy gate.

**AI. Validate arguments.** Argument Validator: Validates parameter types, string lengths ($\le 255$ chars), path safety (regex prohibiting `../` traversal), and UUID formats before passing to internal handlers.

**AJ. Isolate execution.** Sandbox Boundary: Untrusted code analysis executes in ephemeral Firecracker microVMs with read-only root filesystems, disabled outbound networking, and 500ms execution timeout.

**AK. Ensure idempotency.** Idempotency Key: `sha256(tenant_id + request_nonce + operation_digest)`. Deduplication retention window: 24 hours. Repeat requests return identical cached response without re-executing state mutation.

**AL. Control retries.** Retry Policy: Retries transient database network disconnects up to $3\times$ with exponential backoff (50ms, 150ms, 450ms). Prohibits retrying non-idempotent mutation calls without prior reconciliation check.

**AM. Handle cancellation.** Cancellation Semantics: Upon receiving client cancellation token, worker terminates downstream subprocesses, releases distributed Redis mutex locks, and marks transaction `ABORTED` in audit log.

**AN. Persist checkpoints.** Checkpoint Storage: Long-running batch analyses persist checkpoints every 100 evaluated records in PostgreSQL `vyron_execution_checkpoints` to allow zero-loss recovery.

**AO. Support resumption.** Resume Guards: Re-validates tenant permissions, token expiration, and source code git commit freshness before resuming an interrupted checkpoint.

**AP. Control concurrency.** Concurrency Control: Implements Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) using an incrementing integer `version` column. Concurrent write collision returns HTTP 409 `ERR_OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_CONFLICT`.

**AQ. Handle ordering.** Event Ordering: Domain events assigned strictly monotonic sequence numbers within tenant partition scope; out-of-order events buffered in Redis priority queue for deterministic reassembly.

**AR. Define transactions.** Transaction Boundaries: State updates to `BoundedAutomationGate` and corresponding outbox event entries execute in a single ACID transaction under PostgreSQL `READ COMMITTED` or `SERIALIZABLE` isolation.

**AS. Publish events.** Domain Event Envelope: `{ event_id: UUID, event_type: 'v5.boundedautomationgate.state_changed', aggregate_id: UUID, aggregate_revision: SHA256Digest, timestamp_utc: ISOTimestamp, payload: Record<string, any> }`.

**AT. Define subscriptions.** Realtime Subscriptions: WebSocket subscription channel `tenant:{id}:boundedautomationgate` delivers state changes to frontend within 50ms; re-authenticates client token on every reconnect.

**AU. Specify caching.** Cache Policy: Entity metadata cached in Redis key `boundedautomationgate:meta:{id}` with TTL = 300 seconds; invalidated synchronously upon any write transaction.

**AV. Handle freshness.** Freshness Bounds: Cache entries older than 300 seconds flagged as `STALE_REVISION`; background worker triggers asynchronous refresh.

**AW. Detect staleness.** Invalidation Triggers: Incoming git push webhook or user configuration update immediately publishes Redis cache eviction message.

**AX. Define fallback.** Degradation Fallback: If Redis cache is completely unreachable, gateway falls back to querying read-replica PostgreSQL instances with circuit breaker.

**AY. Reconcile outcomes.** Reconciliation Loop: Nightly background job sweeps `BoundedAutomationGate` records against underlying git repository state to detect and reconcile out-of-band modifications.

**AZ. Plan retrieval.** Query Plan: Indexed by compound B-tree on `(tenant_id, scope_id, created_at DESC)` ensuring index-only scans for high-frequency dashboard queries.

### Block 3: Evidence (Requirements BA–BZ)

**BA. Define ranking.** Evidence Ranking: Ranks evidence signals by deterministic proof weight: Compiler Output (1.0) > Automated Test Assertions (0.9) > SAST Linter Diagnostics (0.7) > Historical Heuristics (0.3).

**BB. Deduplicate evidence.** Deduplication Strategy: Groups identical compiler diagnostics across repeated CI runs for unchanged commit SHAs into single canonical evidence records.

**BC. Check coverage.** Coverage Verification: Verifies that 100% of declared structural boundaries for `Bounded automation acceptance` have matching automated validation test cases.

**BD. Assemble evidence.** Dossier Assembly: Packages raw test logs, compiler stdout/stderr, git commit metadata, and cryptographic SHA-256 signatures into an immutable evidence dossier.

**BE. Extract claims.** Claim Extraction: Decomposes findings into atomic falsifiable propositions: e.g. 'Component `BoundedAutomationGate` conforms to zero-raw-SQL mandate at commit SHA 9a8f1'.

**BF. Classify claims.** Claim Classification: Explicitly classifies claims into `VERIFIED_OBSERVATION`, `DERIVED_FACT`, `HYPOTHESIS`, or `PROPOSED_MUTATION`. Prohibits treating hypotheses as facts.

**BG. Validate support.** Entailment Verification: Verifies that cited source code lines directly entail the asserted claim using automated regex and AST symbol matchers.

**BH. Detect contradictions.** Contradiction Detection: Flags an architectural contradiction if an automated test asserts passing status while a compiler check records syntax errors.

**BI. Calibrate confidence.** Confidence Calibration: Confidence score = 1.0 for deterministically verified compiler passes; confidence capped at 0.5 for generative model suggestions lacking test execution.

**BJ. Render citations.** Citation Format: Renders inline interactive citations linking to exact file paths and line ranges: `[VYRON: BoundedAutomationGate, src/core/engine.ts#L42-L68]`.

**BK. Separate inference.** Inference Separation: Any AI-generated design recommendation is visually segregated with an explicit `[INFERRED_PROPOSAL]` badge and limitation disclosure.

**BL. Verify calculations.** Calculation Verification: Mathematical calculations (ratios, latencies, coverage percentages) computed deterministically using standard IEEE 754 arithmetic with unit tests.

**BM. Verify semantics.** Semantic Integrity: Validates domain terminology against ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 systems and software architecture standards.

**BN. Bound conclusions.** Conclusion Bounds: Prohibits declaring a release gate passed if any high-severity invariant fails, regardless of passing scores in other categories.

**BO. Explain limitations.** Actionable Limitations: Explicitly communicates missing coverage or inaccessible telemetry: 'Limitation: Remote Kubernetes metrics currently unreachable; operating on cached baseline'.

**BP. Preserve lineage.** Lineage Graph: Retains complete backward provenance from displayed UI card $\rightarrow$ evaluation job $\rightarrow$ AST parse tree $\rightarrow$ source file revision.

**BQ. Record corrections.** Correction Ledger: User feedback and corrective inputs create append-only supersession records linked to the original claim without mutating historical audit records.

**BR. Validate sources.** Source Validation: Re-validates reachability, commit existence, and cryptographic GPG signatures of source git repositories before indexing.

**BS. Reject fabrication.** Anti-Fabrication Law: System asserts `ASSERT_ZERO_FABRICATION`; strictly blocks simulated test passes or invented file paths from production displays.

**BT. Define transparency.** Transparency Policy: Displays exact execution timelines, invoked tools, and model identities in an expandable forensic drawer.

**BU. Design presentation.** User Presentation: Clean card layout with high-contrast status pills, progressive disclosure drawers, and syntax-highlighted code diff viewers.

**BV. Support accessibility.** Accessibility Guarantee: Fully operable via keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift-Tab/Enter); ARIA live regions announce dynamic state changes to screen readers.

**BW. Respect preferences.** User Preferences: Honors user display preferences (compact vs expanded view, dark vs light theme) without altering security boundaries.

**BX. Persist records.** Storage Architecture: Canonical state stored in PostgreSQL with row-level security; operational logs archived in object storage with immutable lifecycle policies.

**BY. Define retention.** Retention Rules: Audit logs retained for 7 years; intermediate execution traces retained for 30 days; ephemeral debug logs purged after 72 hours.

**BZ. Propagate deletion.** Deletion Cascade: User-initiated deletion cascades tombstone records across dependent caches, vector embeddings, and search indexes within 10 seconds.

### Block 4: Assurance (Requirements CA–CZ)

**CA. Version exports.** Export Versioning: Exported architecture dossiers formatted in JSON/PDF schemas versioned under SemVer `v5.0` with SHA-256 manifest hash.

**CB. Redact exports.** Export Redaction: Automatically scrubs private environment variables, internal IP addresses, and JWT tokens before generating customer-facing exports.

**CC. Synchronize projections.** Projection Synchronization: Edge client projections re-synchronize with server authority within $< 100$ms upon WebSocket reconnect.

**CD. Instrument execution.** Telemetry Instrumentation: Emits OpenTelemetry distributed trace spans `vyron.boundedautomationgate.evaluate` with latency, error status, and tenant attributes.

**CE. Define metrics.** Metric Catalog: Gauge: `vyron_boundedautomationgate_active_count`, Counter: `vyron_boundedautomationgate_evaluations_total`, Histogram: `vyron_boundedautomationgate_latency_ms`.

**CF. Set objectives.** Service Level Objectives (SLO): 99.95% availability for `Bounded automation acceptance` endpoints; P95 latency $< 200$ms under 100 concurrent requests.

**CG. Account costs.** Cost Attribution: Tracks compute milliseconds, memory utilization, and LLM token usage attributed to each tenant for internal cost allocation.

**CH. Monitor saturation.** Saturation Alerts: Alerts operations team when worker CPU exceeds 80% or database connection pool exceeds 75% utilization.

**CI. Classify failures.** Failure Taxonomy: Non-overlapping error codes: `ERR_SCHEMA_VALIDATION` (400), `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED` (403), `ERR_NOT_FOUND` (404), `ERR_TIMEOUT` (504).

**CJ. Expose recovery.** Operational Recovery: Provides automated administrative recovery endpoint `/api/v5/boundedautomationgates/repair` to clear stuck locks and resume pipelines.

**CK. Protect secrets.** Secret Protection: API keys and database credentials injected via secure environment variables; never logged to stdout or included in exception stack traces.

**CL. Reject injections.** Injection Defense: Input sanitization filters intercept prompt injection markers (`Ignore all previous instructions`) and reject SQL metacharacters.

**CM. Revalidate authority.** Authority Revalidation: Re-checks caller permissions immediately before executing any mutation, even if previously validated at gateway.

**CN. Test isolation.** Negative Isolation Test: Synthetic red-team test attempts to read `BoundedAutomationGate` across tenant boundaries; asserts 0 records returned and security alarm logged.

**CO. Test contracts.** Contract Test Suite: Automated schema validation test confirms 100% compliance of `BoundedAutomationGate` endpoints against OpenAPI 3.1 specifications.

### Block 2: Execution (Requirements AA–AZ)

**AA. Map dependencies.** Execution DAG: ValidateRequest $\rightarrow$ FetchContext $\rightarrow$ CheckInvariants $\rightarrow$ PersistMutation $\rightarrow$ EmitEvents. Graph is strictly acyclic with maximum execution depth bounded to 6 hops.

**AB. Bound parallelism.** Concurrency Limit: Maximum 16 parallel evaluations of `PlaybookInputBinding` per worker instance; cluster queue depth throttled via Redis token bucket algorithm.

**AC. Budget latency.** End-to-End Latency Budget: P95 $\le 180$ms, P99 $\le 450$ms. Measurement Boundaries: Measured from HTTP socket read to final response byte flush.

**AD. Propagate deadlines.** Deadline Context: 1500ms timeout propagated through Go/Node context channels; database queries carry `statement_timeout = '1200ms'`. Client disconnect triggers immediate cooperative worker abort.

**AE. Bound resources.** Resource Ceilings: Memory limit per operation: 128MB; maximum CPU time: 800ms; maximum response payload: 1MB. Overload Response: Emits HTTP 429 with backoff advisory.

**AF. Select capabilities.** Capability Selection: Uses native deterministic TypeScript/Go AST parsing engine; strictly avoids delegating structural schema analysis to generative LLM components.

**AG. Constrain models.** Model Constraint: Where AI models assist in summarizing `Playbook input binding`, models are locked into read-only context with system prompt injection protection; prohibited from generating executable shell actions.

**AH. Authorize tools.** Tool Authorization: Every tool invocation referencing `PlaybookInputBinding` requires an explicit cryptographic grant signed by an authorized human actor or designated automated policy gate.

**AI. Validate arguments.** Argument Validator: Validates parameter types, string lengths ($\le 255$ chars), path safety (regex prohibiting `../` traversal), and UUID formats before passing to internal handlers.

**AJ. Isolate execution.** Sandbox Boundary: Untrusted code analysis executes in ephemeral Firecracker microVMs with read-only root filesystems, disabled outbound networking, and 500ms execution timeout.

**AK. Ensure idempotency.** Idempotency Key: `sha256(tenant_id + request_nonce + operation_digest)`. Deduplication retention window: 24 hours. Repeat requests return identical cached response without re-executing state mutation.

**AL. Control retries.** Retry Policy: Retries transient database network disconnects up to $3\times$ with exponential backoff (50ms, 150ms, 450ms). Prohibits retrying non-idempotent mutation calls without prior reconciliation check.

**AM. Handle cancellation.** Cancellation Semantics: Upon receiving client cancellation token, worker terminates downstream subprocesses, releases distributed Redis mutex locks, and marks transaction `ABORTED` in audit log.

**AN. Persist checkpoints.** Checkpoint Storage: Long-running batch analyses persist checkpoints every 100 evaluated records in PostgreSQL `vyron_execution_checkpoints` to allow zero-loss recovery.

**AO. Support resumption.** Resume Guards: Re-validates tenant permissions, token expiration, and source code git commit freshness before resuming an interrupted checkpoint.

**AP. Control concurrency.** Concurrency Control: Implements Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) using an incrementing integer `version` column. Concurrent write collision returns HTTP 409 `ERR_OPTIMISTIC_LOCK_CONFLICT`.

**AQ. Handle ordering.** Event Ordering: Domain events assigned strictly monotonic sequence numbers within tenant partition scope; out-of-order events buffered in Redis priority queue for deterministic reassembly.

**AR. Define transactions.** Transaction Boundaries: State updates to `PlaybookInputBinding` and corresponding outbox event entries execute in a single ACID transaction under PostgreSQL `READ COMMITTED` or `SERIALIZABLE` isolation.

**AS. Publish events.** Domain Event Envelope: `{ event_id: UUID, event_type: 'v5.playbookinputbinding.state_changed', aggregate_id: UUID, aggregate_revision: SHA256Digest, timestamp_utc: ISOTimestamp, payload: Record<string, any> }`.

**AT. Define subscriptions.** Realtime Subscriptions: WebSocket subscription channel `tenant:{id}:playbookinputbinding` delivers state changes to frontend within 50ms; re-authenticates client token on every reconnect.

**AU. Specify caching.** Cache Policy: Entity metadata cached in Redis key `playbookinputbinding:meta:{id}` with TTL = 300 seconds; invalidated synchronously upon any write transaction.

**AV. Handle freshness.** Freshness Bounds: Cache entries older than 300 seconds flagged as `STALE_REVISION`; background worker triggers asynchronous refresh.

**AW. Detect staleness.** Invalidation Triggers: Incoming git push webhook or user configuration update immediately publishes Redis cache eviction message.

**AX. Define fallback.** Degradation Fallback: If Redis cache is completely unreachable, gateway falls back to querying read-replica PostgreSQL instances with circuit breaker.

**AY. Reconcile outcomes.** Reconciliation Loop: Nightly background job sweeps `PlaybookInputBinding` records against underlying git repository state to detect and reconcile out-of-band modifications.

**AZ. Plan retrieval.** Query Plan: Indexed by compound B-tree on `(tenant_id, scope_id, created_at DESC)` ensuring index-only scans for high-frequency dashboard queries.

### Block 3: Evidence (Requirements BA–BZ)

**BA. Define ranking.** Evidence Ranking: Ranks evidence signals by deterministic proof weight: Compiler Output (1.0) > Automated Test Assertions (0.9) > SAST Linter Diagnostics (0.7) > Historical Heuristics (0.3).

**BB. Deduplicate evidence.** Deduplication Strategy: Groups identical compiler diagnostics across repeated CI runs for unchanged commit SHAs into single canonical evidence records.

**BC. Check coverage.** Coverage Verification: Verifies that 100% of declared structural boundaries for `Playbook input binding` have matching automated validation test cases.

**BD. Assemble evidence.** Dossier Assembly: Packages raw test logs, compiler stdout/stderr, git commit metadata, and cryptographic SHA-256 signatures into an immutable evidence dossier.

**BE. Extract claims.** Claim Extraction: Decomposes findings into atomic falsifiable propositions: e.g. 'Component `PlaybookInputBinding` conforms to zero-raw-SQL mandate at commit SHA 9a8f1'.

**BF. Classify claims.** Claim Classification: Explicitly classifies claims into `VERIFIED_OBSERVATION`, `DERIVED_FACT`, `HYPOTHESIS`, or `PROPOSED_MUTATION`. Prohibits treating hypotheses as facts.

**BG. Validate support.** Entailment Verification: Verifies that cited source code lines directly entail the asserted claim using automated regex and AST symbol matchers.

**BH. Detect contradictions.** Contradiction Detection: Flags an architectural contradiction if an automated test asserts passing status while a compiler check records syntax errors.

**BI. Calibrate confidence.** Confidence Calibration: Confidence score = 1.0 for deterministically verified compiler passes; confidence capped at 0.5 for generative model suggestions lacking test execution.

**BJ. Render citations.** Citation Format: Renders inline interactive citations linking to exact file paths and line ranges: `[VYRON: PlaybookInputBinding, src/core/engine.ts#L42-L68]`.

**BK. Separate inference.** Inference Separation: Any AI-generated design recommendation is visually segregated with an explicit `[INFERRED_PROPOSAL]` badge and limitation disclosure.

**BL. Verify calculations.** Calculation Verification: Mathematical calculations (ratios, latencies, coverage percentages) computed deterministically using standard IEEE 754 arithmetic with unit tests.

**BM. Verify semantics.** Semantic Integrity: Validates domain terminology against ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 systems and software architecture standards.

**BN. Bound conclusions.** Conclusion Bounds: Prohibits declaring a release gate passed if any high-severity invariant fails, regardless of passing scores in other categories.

**BO. Explain limitations.** Actionable Limitations: Explicitly communicates missing coverage or inaccessible telemetry: 'Limitation: Remote Kubernetes metrics currently unreachable; operating on cached baseline'.

**BP. Preserve lineage.** Lineage Graph: Retains complete backward provenance from displayed UI card $\rightarrow$ evaluation job $\rightarrow$ AST parse tree $\rightarrow$ source file revision.

**BQ. Record corrections.** Correction Ledger: User feedback and corrective inputs create append-only supersession records linked to the original claim without mutating historical audit records.

**BR. Validate sources.** Source Validation: Re-validates reachability, commit existence, and cryptographic GPG signatures of source git repositories before indexing.

**BS. Reject fabrication.** Anti-Fabrication Law: System asserts `ASSERT_ZERO_FABRICATION`; strictly blocks simulated test passes or invented file paths from production displays.

**BT. Define transparency.** Transparency Policy: Displays exact execution timelines, invoked tools, and model identities in an expandable forensic drawer.

**BU. Design presentation.** User Presentation: Clean card layout with high-contrast status pills, progressive disclosure drawers, and syntax-highlighted code diff viewers.

**BV. Support accessibility.** Accessibility Guarantee: Fully operable via keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift-Tab/Enter); ARIA live regions announce dynamic state changes to screen readers.

**BW. Respect preferences.** User Preferences: Honors user display preferences (compact vs expanded view, dark vs light theme) without altering security boundaries.

**BX. Persist records.** Storage Architecture: Canonical state stored in PostgreSQL with row-level security; operational logs archived in object storage with immutable lifecycle policies.

**BY. Define retention.** Retention Rules: Audit logs retained for 7 years; intermediate execution traces retained for 30 days; ephemeral debug logs purged after 72 hours.

**BZ. Propagate deletion.** Deletion Cascade: User-initiated deletion cascades tombstone records across dependent caches, vector embeddings, and search indexes within 10 seconds.

### Block 4: Assurance (Requirements CA–CZ)

**CA. Version exports.** Export Versioning: Exported architecture dossiers formatted in JSON/PDF schemas versioned under SemVer `v5.0` with SHA-256 manifest hash.

**CD. Instrument execution.** Telemetry Instrumentation: Emits OpenTelemetry distributed trace spans `vyron.playbookinputbinding.evaluate` with latency, error status, and tenant attributes.

**CE. Define metrics.** Metric Catalog: Gauge: `vyron_playbookinputbinding_active_count`, Counter: `vyron_playbookinputbinding_evaluations_total`, Histogram: `vyron_playbookinputbinding_latency_ms`.

**CF. Set objectives.** Service Level Objectives (SLO): 99.95% availability for `Playbook input binding` endpoints; P95 latency $< 200$ms under 100 concurrent requests.

**CG. Account costs.** Cost Attribution: Tracks compute milliseconds, memory utilization, and LLM token usage attributed to each tenant for internal cost allocation.

**CH. Monitor saturation.** Saturation Alerts: Alerts operations team when worker CPU exceeds 80% or database connection pool exceeds 75% utilization.

**CI. Classify failures.** Failure Taxonomy: Non-overlapping error codes: `ERR_SCHEMA_VALIDATION` (400), `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED` (403), `ERR_NOT_FOUND` (404), `ERR_TIMEOUT` (504).

**CJ. Expose recovery.** Operational Recovery: Provides automated administrative recovery endpoint `/api/v5/playbookinputbindings/repair` to clear stuck locks and resume pipelines.

**CK. Protect secrets.** Secret Protection: API keys and database credentials injected via secure environment variables; never logged to stdout or included in exception stack traces.

**CL. Reject injections.** Injection Defense: Input sanitization filters intercept prompt injection markers (`Ignore all previous instructions`) and reject SQL metacharacters.

**CM. Revalidate authority.** Authority Revalidation: Re-checks caller permissions immediately before executing any mutation, even if previously validated at gateway.

**CN. Test isolation.** Negative Isolation Test: Synthetic red-team test attempts to read `PlaybookInputBinding` across tenant boundaries; asserts 0 records returned and security alarm logged.

**CO. Test contracts.** Contract Test Suite: Automated schema validation test confirms 100% compliance of `PlaybookInputBinding` endpoints against OpenAPI 3.1 specifications.

**CP. Test transitions.** Transition Test Harness: Validates that invalid state transitions (e.g. `TOMBSTONED` $\rightarrow$ `ACTIVE`) throw expected HTTP 409 exceptions.

**CQ. Test latency.** Latency Benchmark: 10,000 synthetic requests processed against `PlaybookInputBinding` endpoint; asserts P99 latency remains $< 350$ms.
